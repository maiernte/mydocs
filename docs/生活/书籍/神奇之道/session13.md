ROB USING THE MAGICAL APPROACH. PRECOGNITION.

SEPTEMBER 24, 1980 9:24 P.M., WEDNESDAY

*(Jane hasn’t felt her best today: She’s had a lot of soreness because of muscular changes taking place. First she decided to see if she could have a session, then at 9:10 she decided against it. But when I said I’d return to typing Monday night’s session, in a rather humorous turnabout she decided to hold a session tonight after all. “If he comes through he’ll be doing good,” she said. “I don’t feel him around.” As I wrote these notes at 9:20, however, she*
*did begin to feel Seth’s presence. “You’re not deserted after all,” I said.*

*(Just before we sat for the session Jane finished reading my account of my “light of the universe” experience of last Sunday evening, September 21, and my account of the experience involving ... clairvoyance ... precognition ... that I’d had at naptime today, involving my idea for a novel and an article in tonight’s Star-Gazette, Elmira’s daily newspaper. I describe both of these events in my dream notebook.*

*(“I wish there were words to use besides clairvoyance or precognition,” I said, since I was somewhat reluctant to attach them to the newspaper experience. That is, at the time I hadn’t had any feeling that those qualities or terms might apply to what I’d sensed — nor do I now. Perhaps I was merely afraid the experience wasn’t clairvoyant, I said, yet I felt our vocabulary was limited in some indefinable way in such cases. A copy of my newspaper experience is attached to this session.[^1]*

*(I must say that I hadn’t expected Seth to discuss the event this evening, nor had I asked that he do so. Also, for someone who wasn’t sure they wanted to hold a session to begin with, Jane’s delivery was excellent — usually fast and quite emphatic throughout.)*

Now: Comments.
(“Good evening.”)

If you had first read the article of which you have been speaking, and then in a semi-dozing state created your idea of a novel, replete with the characterization of the mother, then you would say that cause and effect were involved.

Science might admit that the novel idea itself was highly creative, an example of the mind at play as it used experience as a creative raw product — but of course you had your experience before you read the article. And when that kind of thing happens science then proclaims that the two events are not connected to each other at all, but are instead the result of coincidental patterns.

In your terms, whether a minute or 10 minutes, or an hour or two hours were involved, you reacted ahead of time to a headline that you had not as yet physically encountered. You reacted creatively, using the precognitive story as a basis for a fictional endeavor. You turned it to art’s purposes.

(9:31.) Give us a moment ... As you lay there you were aware of the fact just beneath consciousness — usual consciousness — that you had not brought in the paper before your nap, as is your habit, and almost at a dream level you idly wondered what stories it might contain. Your inclusion of the hospital mixup in the tale was, as, you suspected, connected with the medical ideas you have been dealing with of late (in extra notes for Mass Events, and the book by the physician) — and here was an excellent fictional idea, you see, that could, among other things, bring those ideas into prominence.

The idea, then, of the novel came from past and future events, though you were to catch up with those future events very quickly. Your mind intuitively organized all of that material, and put it together in a completely new fashion. Sometimes when such events occur, the precognitive trigger is not even recognized when it is encountered physically, because it happens too far ahead of time. (To me:) You organize mental and physical events in a creative manner. In this case a novel was involved because the concept, while strongly involving images, carried a time span that would make narrative necessary.

You used the magical approach. You caught yourself in the act of acting naturally, of demonstrating abilities that your society to a large degree does not admit. That same kind of lightning-swift organization goes on within the body itself constantly, as it deals with probable scenarios to which you may or may not end up reacting to.

The events themselves discussed in the newspaper article point up the same kind of magical affiliations. The c-e-l-l-s (spelled) of the young men in question were always in communication, and all of those elements needed to bring about such a reunion took place at that magical level of activity. Consciously, intellectually, the boys had no idea they were triplets. You live personally in a world of lush creative ideas. Your intellect is aware of that. (Pause.) It is used to working creatively. The focused intellect can indeed activate the intuitive abilities — and the healing abilities. You get what you concentrate upon.

(9:45.) The intellect is a vital organizer even if it is not aware of the magical levels of activity from which often its best ideas emerge.

This will be a very brief session. When you look at world events, however, the present world situation for example (the war between Iraq and Iran, which began a few days ago), try to enlarge the scope of your intellectual reach, so that you consider world events as living multidimensional “novels” being formed in the present in response to both future and past triggers. The impact of the future on the past, in your terms — or rather, the implications of the future on the present — are highly important, and such precognitive reactions are as vital, numerous, and real as you ordinarily think that the reactions to past events are (intently).

This puts present world events in an entirely different perspective. Men act, then, in relationship to events that have, historically speaking, not yet occurred — but those events happening, say, in the future, in certain terms cast their shadows back into the present, or illuminate the past according to the events’ characteristics. There is always more going on than ordinary sense data show.

In your comparatively simple experience, you can see, however, the implications of such activities. Men may react to future events by unconsciously translating them into art, or motion pictures. They may react by unconsciously taking certain steps of a political nature that seem at the time either unreasonable, or even incomprehensible — steps whose logic appears only in hindsight.

The same occurs, of course, in all areas of human behavior, as well as in the behavior of animals and even of plants. This future shadowing the present, or future illuminating the present, represents a vital element in the formation of events as they are perceived in time. In a fashion the triplets were reacting in their past to a future event that has now caught up with them, so that each of their actions in any moment of that past happened as a result of a tension — a creative tension — between the event of their original separation and the event of their future reunion.

I do not mean that the reunion was inevitable or predestined, but the vigor of that probability, you might say, magnified the original tension. I want Ruburt to apply all of this to his own situation, both in terms of creative endeavors and his physical situation, so that he begins to understand that he can start to react in the present to a future recovery.

(Long pause at 10:01.) He can see how important periods of letting go are. Your experience happened when you were nearly asleep, but merely relaxed, not worrying, with your intellect in a kind of free flow. You were not hampering it. It was momentarily free of limiting beliefs, and it naturally used — and chose to use — the magical approach to answer what was a very simple, now-forgotten intellectual question: What might be in today’s newspaper?

The usual answer, or the usual method of obtaining an answer, was at the time inconvenient: You were not about to get up, go outside and get the paper, so on its own the intellect pressed the magical-approach button, you might say, getting the information the quickest and easiest way possible.

It did not give you the bare headline, however — even though that and the story were perceived far too quickly for you to follow. What you were aware of were your own creative reveries in response to that information.

Now left alone, the intellect will often solve problems in just such a fashion, when it is allowed to, when you forget what is supposed to be possible and what is not, when you forget that your mind is supposed to be pedestrian and parochial.

(Pause.) End of session —
(I smiled at Seth as “he” leaned toward me. “I thought so. It’s been very interesting.”)
— and a fond good evening.

(“Thank you. The same to you. Good night.”

*(10:09 P.M. “Brilliant, hon,” I said to Jane as she quickly came out of her trance state. She was pleased. For someone who hadn’t known whether they wanted a session, she’d done very well, with her delivery being often fast and emphatic. I told her that it looked as though Seth used my newspaper incident to actually summarize in capsule form much of the material he’s been giving us in this latest group of private sessions. “You couldn’t ask for a better demonstration of the whole thing,” I said.*

*(I intend to copy a page or two of the session to insert in my notebook containing suggestions of notes for Dreams, Seth’s latest book. I mean the material about time. I also thought we should somehow keep the session in mind, and not let it get lost in the files as the years pass — one of the reasons I want to use part of it in Dreams. Since it’s private, it might not be published any time soon otherwise.*

*(A note: the way things “work” ... On Thursday morning—the day after this session was held — Jane and I saw the three young men referred to in the newspaper article on a well-known variety show. Very interesting. One of them said he’d had “a dream” about having brothers. The others weren’t as definite, but at least indicated they hadn’t felt alone. The TV host never referred to the fact that the three youths were actually members of quadruplets — that a fourth brother had died at birth, according to the news article. Neither did the brothers. I also mentioned to Jane the similarity in the adoptive last names of two of the brothers: Kellman and Gelland.)*

------------------NOTE: SESSION OF SEPTEMBER 24, 1980-------------------



[^1]: Experience, 4:00 P.M., Wednesday, September 24, 1980.

I lay down for a nap in the bedroom after Jane got up from her own. I had the following ideas as I lay in that state between waking and sleeping. I found myself musing about what I thought was a great idea for a novel. I tried to describe it to Jane as we ate supper and watched the news on TV.

I thought of myself as a woman at the mall in Big Flats, near Elmira. As I went through a double revolving door I caught a glimpse of a young man, say in his mid-twenties, who was an exact duplicate of my own son, who I knew was not in the mall, but was away on business of some kind. The shock of seeing my son’s double was so great that instead of chasing him to question him, I had to sit down on a bench to recover. By then the young man was gone. I envisioned myself returning to the mall again and again to see if I could see the person — and finally I did. Either I followed him to his car, then talked to him, or followed him to where he lived with his parents — but he bore an uncanny resemblance to my own son.

I do not know how or when the two look-a-like young men met — but in my reverie I thought of the mother in question tracing back connections all the way to her son’s birth at the Elmira hospital. I envisioned the delivery rooms there, and the room where visitors see their babies (I’ve never seen those rooms in “real” life).

The story unfolds when the mother uncovers evidence of a mixup in the baby complex at the hospital: She had been given only one of her children, or some such affair; either that, or she had managed to adopt a baby from there. Either way, she finds out through much detective work that a whole series of mixups had occurred in the hospital that day — that in the Elmira area there are several sets of parents who have been raising the wrong children all these years. There had been mixups in the hospital because of new help, etc. I thought it would make a great novel as all of the entangled threads were unwound, and considering the emotional tangles that had been built up over the years as parents raised children they thought were theirs.

I think that the idea of mixups in the hospital came from a book Jane and I have been reading the past week, written by a doctor who warns against medicine, delivery rooms, the whole bit, in the establishment practice of medicine. He wrote that such baby mixups are far from rare. Then as we sat on the couch, I remembered that for the first time in literally months I’d forgotten to bring in the evening paper, so we could look at it while we ate and watched TV. I almost invariably bring in the paper before I lay down for a nap before supper, so Jane can read it while I sleep.

On the front page of the paper was a rather long story, with photographs, telling how triplets were united by “chance” last weekend in New York City — a case we hadn’t heard of in the media before now. I’d forgotten to describe my idea for a novel to Jane, but the article immediately reminded me to do so. There were similarities in the story that reminded me of my own experience. The first two of the brothers were reunited through a friend (instead of a mother, say) who noticed the resemblance between them. Turns out the three were given up for adoption at birth, and although they knew they were adopted, they didn’t know they belonged to what actually had been a quadruplet group. (A fourth brother had died at birth.) Their unknowing would match my own dreamlike idea of the two young men living in the Elmira area but not knowing of each other. Even the ages of the triplets — 19 years — places them fairly close to my son’s age of 25 in my reverie, rather than, for example, brothers in their 40s.

I was quite struck by the similarities between the news story and my own experience. Jane thinks that because I forgot to bring in the paper before I lay down, I may have tuned into it, out there in the box beside the mailbox. I didn’t have any strong feeling that I had, however, but get a few thrills as I finish this account.

I should add that I lay down at about 4:20. On weekdays the motor carrier usually leaves the paper in its box around 3:15–3:30, so the paper was “in position” for me to zoom in on it. In fact, we can see our box on the road from our bedroom windows, looking slightly north. I pull the shades before lying down. I don’t remember if I happened to glance at the box today while lowering them. The box is perhaps 45–50 feet from the bedroom windows, and its backend is toward our house. I can tell if the paper has come, though, by looking across the road into our neighbor’s box. On weekends, when the paper is delivered in the morning, and is sometimes late, I often check the neighbor’s box.
