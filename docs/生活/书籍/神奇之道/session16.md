JANE’S POSITIVE RESULTS. 
OCTOBER 6, 19809:14 P.M., MONDAY

(The following private material is from the regular 920th session. Seth often did this — whether we asked him to or not — closing out book and/or general sessions with comments of varying length for Jane and me.

(10:38.) A note: Ruburt’s body is continuing to respond. The legs and arms are lengthening, and becoming stronger. He should be feeling increased quickness of motion in some respects soon. He is doing well, concentrating upon the good moods, which have increased as a result. And I bid you both a fond good evening.

(“Thank you, Seth.”

(Seth nodded and closed Jane’s eyes. (“Good night.”

(10:40 P.M.)
