MULTIDIMENSIONAL SPIRITUAL DRAMAS.

SEPTEMBER 15, 1980 8:52 P.M., MONDAY

*(Today Jane has been really “out of it.” She’s felt a lot of muscular discomfort with her physical improvements, though, making it hard to concentrate. By 8:30, when she’d finished doing the dishes, the overall soreness had dissipated to some degree, but she appeared to be so groggy with relaxation that I hardly expected her to want to have a session. She yawned again and again. At 8:40 she surprised me by calling out from the living room — I sat reading a magazine at the kitchen table — that she’d try to have a*
*short session. “I feel something about religion. ...”*

*(“Oh, Lord,” I said, joking. For I was embroiled in trying to produce a note relative to a passage of Seth’s in Mass Events about Christ’s resurrection and ascension. For several reasons, interruptions among them, I’d found it difficult to get into the work, and had spent the weekend reading to remind myself of background material. I wanted the note to be coherent, without going into too much detail. Jane has also contributed an excellent paragraph of material for it. As I have before, I found the whole religious issue confusing and contradictory. And the last thing I’d expected of Jane tonight was any material on religion from Seth. Obviously, my own hassles about the subject were prompting her efforts, I thought.*

*(One of the interruptions concerned the overflow of water from a cellar bathroom. Last night I’d discovered that a portion of the cellar floor — including the old “bomb shelter” where I keep our fan mail stored — was covered by a quarter inch of water —just enough to soak into the 2 by 4’s I have the cardboard boxes placed upon [to avoid water!]. If the wooden supports soak up enough water they can bleed into the very porous boxes. So I had some damp correspondence to resurrect — without too much trouble, actually. The plumber cleaned out the house’s sewer line this afternoon, and I spent much time mopping up six full buckets of dirty water.*

*(Jane’s delivery for Seth seemed to be the same as ever, except that she took longer pauses between sentences — almost as though she waited a bit each time to gather the impetus to deal with her very relaxed physical state. But the material is excellent, as usual, and I will be working with it while doing the note for Mass Events.)*

Now: Good evening.

(“Good evening, Seth.”)

A few comments.

Now: Christ was not crucified — therefore he did not resurrect, coming out of the tomb, nor did he then ascend into heaven. In the terms of the biblical drama (underlined), however, Christ was crucified.
He arose from the tomb and ascended into heaven. The resurrection and the ascension are indeed, however, the two parts of one dramatic event. (Pause.) Dogmatically, arising from the dead alone was clearly not sufficient, for men were to follow where Christ led. You could not have a world in which the newly-risen dead mixed with the living. An existence in a spiritual realm had to follow such a resurrection.

(Pause.) Now in the facts of history, there was no crucifixion, resurrection, or ascension. In the terms of history there was no biblical Christ (pause), whose life followed the details given. The organization of the church is a historical fact. The power, devotion, and energy, the organizational expertise of Christianity, cannot be disputed. Nor can it be disputed that Christianity was based upon great religious and psychic vision. To some extent it involved the intuitional reorganization of subjective, and then objective, realities.

(Long pause at 9:05.) I have told you, however, that the world of events springs from the world of ideas. It seems certain that “something” happened “back then” (as I often remark) — and that if you could go back there, invisibly studying the century, you would discover the birth of Christianity (also as I’ve remarked, although I prefer to say that “I’d like to see what did happen”). But Christianity was not born at that time. (Long pause.) You might say that the labor pains (intently) were happening then, but the birth itself did not emerge for some time later.

Jewish shepherds represented the placenta that was meant to be discarded, for it was Jewish tradition that nourished the new religion in its early stages before its birth. Christ, as you know, was a common name, so when I say that there was a man named Christ involved in those events (see Seth Speaks), I do not mean to say that he was the biblical Christ. His life was one of those lives that were finally used to compose the composite image of the biblical Christ.

The mass psyche was seeking for a change, an impetus, a flowering, a new organization. The idea of a redeemer was hardly new, but ancient in many traditions. As I stated before, that part of the world was filled with would-be messiahs, self-proclaimed prophets, and so forth, and in those terms it was only a matter of time before man’s great spiritual and psychic desires illuminated and filled up that psychological landscape, filling the prepared psychological patterns with a new urgency and intent. There were many throw-away messiahs (with gentle amusement) — men whose circumstances, characteristics, and abilities were almost (musically) the ones needed — who almost (musically) filled the psychic bill, but who were unfitted for other reasons: They were of the wrong race, or their timing was off. Their intersection with space and time did not mesh with the requirements.

(Pause.) You must understand the long trail of psychological reality that exists before you have a physical event. You must understand man’s need and capacity for fulfillment, dramatization, and psychic creativity.
There is nothing that happened in those times that is not happening now in your own: You have numberless gurus, people who seemingly perform miracles (and some do). So there were in those days some rather disconnected events that served as the focus point for great psychic activity: People wanted to believe, and their belief changed the course of history. It doesn’t matter that the events never happened — the belief happened. And the belief was man’s response to (long pause) intuitional knowledge, to inner knowing, and to spiritual comprehension.

(9:25.) These all had to flow into reality, into psychological patterns through man’s own understanding. They had to flow into the events of history as he (underlined) experienced history. They had to touch the times, and they did so by transforming those times for later generations.

I want it understood (pause) that the accomplishment (pause) is breathtaking in its grandeur — more so because man formed from his psyche such a multidimensional spiritual drama that its light struck upon this or that person, this or that place, and formed a story (pause) more powerful than any physical event could be — hence its power (emphatically).

In those terms, however, again, the gods of Olympus were as real, for all of men’s riches are representations, psychic dramatizations, standing for an inner reality that cannot be literally expressed or described — but can be creatively expressed or represented.

(Long pause.) Too-literal translations of such material often lead to grief, and the creative thrust becomes lost. The great mystery, of course, and great questions, rest in the nature of that inner reality from which man weans (repeated at my question) his religions, and in the power of the creative abilities themselves that bring them into birth (all quite intently). Such activities on a large scale are the end result of each natural person’s individual relationship with nature, and with nature’s source.

(Pause.) Now: Ruburt is progressing very well, and with your help, and both of you should become more and more aware of the natural persons that you are. Do you have a question?

(“No, I think you’ve covered the material very well.”) Then I bid you a fond good evening.

(“Thank you very much, Seth. Good night.”

*(9:38 P.M. Jane agreed with my own surprise that she not only chose to hold the session, but discussed the Christ material. She said that in spite of her being so relaxed, “There Seth was, right there. ...” as soon as she went into trance. But now she was just as much at ease as she had been before the session. She had taken many long pauses during her delivery, a few of which I’ve indicated.*

*(Jane laughed as we talked. “You don’t have to publish it, but I have the feeling that he — Seth — would have said all that earlier, a long time ago, if*

*I’d let him. ...”*
*(“Well,” I said, “maybe he would have if I’d encouraged him to do so*
*too.”*
*(She agreed.)*
