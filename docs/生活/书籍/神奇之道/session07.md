THE INTELLECT AS A CULTURAL ARTIFACT. CREATING ONE’S OWN EXPERIENCE. 

AUGUST 28, 1980 8:37 P.M., THURSDAY

*(Jane was so uncomfortable from the hot and humid weather last night that she didn’t hold the regularly scheduled session. The temperature reached 94 degrees yesterday; at bedtime it was still 75, with a humidity of 68%. It’s the latter that she reacts to the most, it seems from my viewpoint. She promised a “short session” for this evening. I’ve often hesitated to mention it, but as I did remark a few days ago, I feel her reaction to the weather must have other causes — that is, besides those having to do with simple environmental conditions. As it is, life within the environment becomes difficult. Nor am I discussing living in an “ideal” environment all the time.*

*(Today has been much cooler. I was almost chilly in my cutoffs as we sat for the session at 8:30. Jane has felt much better. Her walking continues to improve, as well as her anatomy generally. She’s succeeded very well in maintaining steady improvements that are most heartening to us both.*
*(Seth comments on weather tonight. He began the session very quietly, and took many pauses, including a number of long ones, as the session progressed.)*

Good evening.

(“Good evening, Seth.”)

Now: The intellect is far more socially oriented than is generally understood.

Some of this, again, is difficult to explain (pause), but in a fashion the intellect is a cultural (underlined) phenomenon. Period. It is amazingly resilient, in that according to the belief structures of any given historical period, it can orient itself along the lines of those beliefs, using all of its reasoning abilities to bring such a world picture into focus, collecting data that agree, and rejecting what does not.

Obviously, the mind can use its reasoning abilities, for example, to come to the conclusion that there is a single god behind the functioning of the world, that there are many gods, that divinity is a fantasy, and that the world itself springs from no reasonable source. New sentence: Like statistics, the reasoning abilities can be used to come to almost any conclusion. This is done, again, by taking into consideration within any given system of reasoning only the evidence that agrees with the system’s premises.

This flexibility allows the species great variation overall in its psychological and cultural and political and religious activities. (Long pause.) When any system of reasoning becomes too rigid, however, there are always adjustments made that will allow other information to intrude — otherwise, of course, your belief systems would never change.

Your species shares with the other species a feeling of kinship for its kind. There is a great give-and-take of ideas. You end up, then, with a consensus, generally speaking, as to what a reasonable picture of agreed- upon reality is. Your system has frowned upon many experiences, considering them eccentric behavior in an adverse fashion, since your belief systems have so regimented behavior, and so narrowly defined sanity. (Long pause.) The intellect, I want to stress, is socially oriented. It is peculiarly suited, of course, to react to cultural information. (Pause.) It wants to see the world as it is seen by the minds of others. Through that kind of action it helps form your cultural environment, the civilization of which you are justly proud.

(8:54.) The intellect, then, helps your species translate its own natural purposes and intents — the purposes and intents of the natural person — into their “proper” cultural context, so that those abilities the natural person possesses can benefit the civilization of its time. Those purposes and intents literally change the world. The intellect’s expectations and intents spontaneously and automatically trigger the proper bodily mechanisms to bring about the necessary environmental interactions, and your intent as expressed through your intellect directs your experience of the world.

I am speaking about the intellect here for our discussion, but remember it is everywhere cushioned also. There are backup systems, in other words (amused). If the intellect believes that the world (pause) is a threat to existence, then that belief will alter its intents, of course, and therefore the body’s activities. The beliefs of the intellect operate then as powerful suggestions, particularly when the intellect identifies with those beliefs, so that there is little distance between the intellect and the beliefs that it holds as true.
(Pause in an intent delivery.) I am doing my best to explain the very practical aspects of the intellect’s beliefs, and their strength in drawing experience to you. At one time you both had difficulty with understanding some of these ideas. (Pause.) Your own relationship, your private beliefs about the sort of persons you wanted individually for mates, brought about incalculable actions that led finally to your meeting — yet it all happened “quite naturally,” of course. Your beliefs bring you into correspondence with the elements likely to lead to their affirmation. They draw from Framework 2 all of the necessary ingredients. They elicit from other people behavior that is in keeping with those beliefs.
Your own attitudes, for example — and beliefs — about foreigners, Prentice-Hall, people’s stupidity and lack of integrity, put you in correspondence with those same beliefs on the part of others, resulting in the translation fiasco.1 An entirely different kind of behavior could have been elicited from those same people. Like attracts like in that regard. Those same people, for example, all have, as you do, beliefs in people’s trustworthiness, and so forth — but under those conditions, at that time, you each — or rather you all — were in correspondence at many levels. The books were published. They have helped many people, and that is because you were also in correspondence as far as many of your more positive beliefs are concerned, and those did outweigh the others.

You get what you concentrate upon, and your beliefs are largely responsible for those areas in which you concentrate.

(9:14.) There are no magical methods, only natural ones that you use all of the time, although in some cases you use them for beliefs that you take for truths, when instead they are quite defective assumptions. A small example — one, incidentally, that Ruburt finally realized; but it is a beautiful instance of natural methods. He used it beautifully, even though the results were not pleasing at first. It also shows Ruburt’s growing understanding: He heard tomorrow’s weather report (yesterday), groaned, thought of a very uncomfortable 90-degree temperature tomorrow [and] imagined himself miserable with the heat. Indeed, he began to feel warmer. In a flash he remembered previous days of discomfort, and in the next moment he projected those into the weekend. He felt trapped. Midway through this process he tried to catch himself, but he believed that his body could not handle the heat — and that belief outweighed his intent to change his thoughts, so they kept returning for perhaps ten minutes.

He continued, however, to remind himself that he was not going to worry about tomorrow today, regardless. He told himself that the prediction might be wrong, and he began with his intellect to pile up evidence that could in one way or another bring about a different, more beneficial experience. He did this by recognizing the way he had earlier been building up the picture in the old manner, by collecting all the evidence that fitted it. He used the same process, only for a more beneficial picture, and the process works. You have only to become aware of it.

Your experience will follow your concentration and belief and expectation. The mind is a great discriminator. It can use its reasoning to bring about almost any possible experience within your framework.

Now: Ruburt’s body is definitely recovering normal motion. Laying down is excellent. The additional moving about, however, from one place to another, is most beneficial. The sensations in his buttocks of heat, even burning at times, and in the legs and feet, all represent additional motion and beneficial activity. Sometimes at night the activity might make him feel uncomfortable, but the body is activating itself in certain ways while it is supported.

Have him write a poem a day, and do an ink sketch. The thought came to him. It is a good one, while mind and body both relax.

(With some amusement:) I think that your painting of the dog is excellent.

(“Thank you.”)
I am not an artist, but I know what I like as much as anyone else does.
End of session, with one point: These changes in Ruburt’s body are as magical as any precognitive dream in that regard. A fond good evening,

*(“Thank you, Seth. The same to you. Good night.”*

*(9:30 P.M. The session had been a relatively short one after all. I told Jane it was very good. Seth referred to the painting I’m working on of my dream of last August 16, — the one in which I’m kneeling at the kitchen storm door and thrusting my hand through the glass to touch Gus, the dog who belongs to our neighbors across the street. Seth and Jane have both analyzed this excellent dream.2 Today I’d shown Jane how far I’ve progressed with a charcoal drawing based upon the dream, with a little preliminary color added to some parts of it.*
*(The theme of the dream had interested me pictorially from the beginning, I told her, but I’d almost lacked the nerve to try a rendition of it in paint. Late last week I started the charcoal drawing for the painting, however, figuring I could only try to see what I could do... So far, so good.)*



-------------NOTES: SESSION OF AUGUST 28, 1980--------------

[^1]:  In October 1979 Jane and I saw, to our dismay, that the Dutch publisher of the translation of Seth Speaks had violated his contract with Prentice-Hall by making many unauthorized cuts in the book. It was supposed to be published in its entirety, but language difficulties led to the mixup. After hearing from Jane and me and her editor, Tam Mossman, the Dutch publisher agreed to market a new, uncut translation of Seth Speaks this year. This will be an expensive undertaking — one we feel bad about now that our initial anger has passed.
