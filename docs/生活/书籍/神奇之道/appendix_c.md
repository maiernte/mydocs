JANE AND ROB MEET A SKEPTICAL PSYCHOLOGIST AND HIS MAGIC. JANE’S

Gramacy was a psychologist and a magician, and he came to our house because he was a scientist looking for some real magic. He was a compact, dark-skinned and dark-haired person with soft brown large eyes that were kept half closed when he was being a psychologist, and turned larger, commanding and yet inviting when he was being a magician. Both his eyes and his hands were really too expressive for a scientist’s, and he tried to be a scientist even when he was being a magician — perhaps then most of all.

He turned on a small recorder; classical music with a tinny quality swirled through the room. He bowed his dark head for just a moment then lifted it, those soft eyes now ... softer and harder at the same time; his hands moved in rhythm with the music; his whole body was a marvel of motion; shoulders, head, arms, chest — his whole trunk, responding to the music. 

Then at his command, four silver dollars disappeared through the tabletop and he caught them underneath in the palm of his hands. Playing cards appeared and disappeared. He was in a trance of his own; so were Rob and I, watching. And in the back of his mind was the improbable hope that one day, somehow, the coins would really go through the tabletop. ...
“Or that something will happen to me, that will prove that there is more to life than usual cause and effect,” he said to us. “I almost believe that there is. But in my own life, I can’t find it. It’s not in my bag of tricks,” he went on suggestively. “But if someone else told me things about myself that no one could know. ...”

“Why not catch yourself with knowledge you’re not supposed to have?” I suggested.
POEM: “MAGIC IS PUBLIC AS THE AIR ...”

“Like precognitive information? I never have any. That’s what I mean,” he said.

I replied, “Haven’t you ever known that someone was going to call you, just a moment before the party actually called on the phone? Or haven’t you ever known that the doorbell would ring just before it did, or that you’d meet someone you hadn’t seen in a long time just before you actually do meet?”

“Coincidence,” Gramacy answered dourly. “I’d explain such instances that way.”

“But if you wrote down each such instance and kept track, you might find that there were too many to assign to coincidence, or discover that coincidence couldn’t apply to some at all,” I said. “You’d have your own growing body of instances to examine. You can’t prove that coincidence is or isn’t responsible for such things, but you could consider the unofficial hypothesis as a possibility. You might find that you have proof of precognition in your own life that you’re ignoring.”

He raised a furry eyebrow: “I’d still rather have some really great event happen. I mean, why not?” He grinned. “Like the New York Times ad test with Seth you two did and wrote up in The Seth Material. Now that would convince me!”

Rob replied, “That test was just one of many we did. We didn’t discount anything. When you use coincidence as a handy explanation for everything, then you never get that far.”

Gramacy nodded. “I know a magician can duplicate almost any physical manifestation that a psychic can perform. ...”

“That’s why we don’t bother with effects that can be duplicated,” Seth suddenly said, “but with this performance and our books, which cannot be duplicated. For where does the material in the books come from? Where does it keep coming from?”

“Uh,” Gramacy said. Rob laughed. And in a twinkling I’d changed into Seth. “Look” I said, “no strings, no cards hidden within cards, no bag of tricks beside me on the floor.” Smiling, hearty, Seth talked about magic and cause and effect, but at the same time he demonstrated a magic that is beyond the clever manipulation of appearances. Another personality from whatever realm had joined the party.

It’s really unfortunate and quite unusual that we didn’t record the session. Seth came through before I thought to remind Gramacy that he could record Seth, if Seth came through. But somehow in my mind at least, not recording that session added to it’s magical quality ... the spontaneous psychological or psychic transformation came and went ... We were sitting at the living-room table with the lamplight clear on my face; Gramacy could follow Seth’s psychological passage; see my features change, taking on ever so subtly those other contours. And Seth’s voice was jovial, booming, you didn’t have to strain to hear those words. There was no prepared message either. We hadn’t known that Gramacy was a scientist until he told us that night, and it was as a magician rather than as a scientist that Seth addressed him, telling him to trust his dramatic and imaginative flair.

Magic is public

as the air,

so obvious

and clear that it appears invisible.

And we look through it at the world,

which rises up about us everywhere.

When we wake up

in the morning,

the world is always there waiting.

We never catch it coming or going,

and no smallest part of it disappears

before our eyes,

but stays intact.

But all of that implies just too much precision

to happen all by itself,

a whole world mysteriously

appearing

out of nowhere, putting itself together

just right

without instructions or previous experience.

Such a masterly

production

makes me think instead that there are

clues

we’ve overlooked.

We like to think

that chance alone collected the pieces of

the world,

stitching together the continents,

turning the dumb elements into fish and fowl,

and you and me, finally.

Of Master Magicians whose conjurings

feature the amazing tricks of space and time, produced so skillfully

and fast

that we’re dazzled with

the effects,

and miss the magical slights of hand beneath

the flashy gestures

of the days and nights.

Producing

from it’s magical bag

of tricks,

one marvelous form

of life after another,

fish,

bird,

monkey,

man

(not just one dove

or rabbit)

with a skill and swiftness so astute

that our wise men think one turns into the other!

Juggling a

million million

atoms

all at once,

spinning them into twirling cells of men

and whales,

tricky,

spinning solid mountains from thin air,

with fish transformed into flying birds —

Now that’s A Magic Show!
