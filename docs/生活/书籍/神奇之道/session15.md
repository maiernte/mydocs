THE NATURAL PERSON AND THE NATURAL USE OF TIME.

OCTOBER 1, 1980 9:31 P.M., WEDNESDAY

*(During her mid-morning exercise-and-rest break today, I asked Jane if she had any idea why Seth had come through with the material he’d given us in last Monday evening’s session. At first she said no, rather matter-of- factly. Then: “Well, I don’t tell you everything, but for some time now I’ve known Seth gives what I call ‘fill-in’ sessions, or ‘floating material’— stuff he could give any time. It isn’t private, really, or book work either. They’re like ‘maintenance sessions.’ It’s good material, all right, but. ...”*

*(“So after all these years I find that out,” I answered. “What else haven’t you told me? How come the big secret?”*

*(“You never asked me,” she said, which had a familiar ring. [Checking later, I found that she’d given me the same answer about certain Seth material in Mass Events.]*

*(“Well, I can’t ask you about something I don’t suspect,” I said. I asked her to write a short account of what she’d just told me, and she produced it while sitting in bed, after she’d done her exercises:*

*(“October 1/80. There are certain sessions I’ve labelled ‘fill-in’ sessions in my mind for some time now, or thought of them as covering ‘floating material.’ They aren’t book sessions or specifically personal ones. They keep the sessions going over periods of time. Like maintenance sessions, but usually by discussing past material — connecting it with the present [‘connective sessions’ is more like it] — while not necessarily adding new thrust. And not specifically given to one subject.*

*(“Originally the Christ sessions started that way.*

*(“I think such connective sessions happen between book sessions, for a change of pace — where material doesn’t have to fit a more concentrated overall book focus. 11:15 A.M.”*

*(Jane has grown increasingly restless over the breaks in her activities that are caused by the rest periods she’s taking several times daily. At the same time her back, for example, has improved considerably. She was angry as we sat for the session. “I’m so mad I can’t talk about it,” she said — while talking about it for some 20 minutes. I told her I knew she didn’t want to take the rest periods, and that I had little to offer as an alternative, beyond her simply cutting down on them. I figured she’d be altering her schedule. “Boy, Seth, you’d better bail me out,” she said vehemently. “I can’t have a session on it because I’m too involved — you have to calm down before you can do that. ...”*

*(I did say that her walking was the key to recovery: The more she walked, the less the pressure in any consistent way on other parts of her anatomy. Yet I couldn’t equate the few moments she spent walking with the half-hour rest periods, either.*
*(In spite of her protestations, however, Jane felt Seth near as we talked — then when he came through he did discuss the subjects we were concerned about at the moment.)*

Now: Comments.
(I nodded.)

Our friend is now feeling somewhat more ambitious of late. A few weeks ago, he could hardly wait to lie down at the appointed times, like it otherwise or no, simply because he was so uncomfortable.
Now, things have changed somewhat. The sharp discomfort has gone. A few weeks ago he barely considered taking two steps in the kitchen, much less walking twice the length of the living room, or considering walking after dinner.

The fact that he is now thinking of walking after dinner is an obvious advance. His irritability is somewhat natural — but also based on the idea, still, that when he is laying down that is dead time (with amusement), or useless time, enforced inactivity. It would help, of course, if he reminded himself that his creative mind is at work whether or not he is aware of it, and regardless of what he is doing, and that such periods have the potential, at least, of accelerating creativity, if he allows his intellect to go into a kind of free drive at such times. You might have him become more aware of when he actually becomes tired, or uncomfortable, so that he does lay down then.

The walking after dinner would be excellent, of course — the idea being, however, that if he became uncomfortable from sitting that he lie on the bed, perhaps before watching television for the evening.
One important point, again, is to remember that in any given day his mood is often excellent for many periods of time. He should concentrate his attention upon those periods, rather than concentrating upon the periods when he is blue or upset, and berating himself for those reactions.

In that way, the good moods become longer. They increase. They (underlined) become significant. In such ways he will discover what promotes these good moods. Later, I will have some things to say about what I will call “the daily hypothesis,” for each person has such a daily hypothesis — one that might be quite different for, say, Friday than it is for Monday. You build your daily experience partially by such working hypotheses.

(9:44 in a fast delivery.) Give us a moment... .(Long pause.) To some extent Ruburt’s dissatisfaction with laying down after dinner also means that he is learning more about his own natural rhythms, for he does feel accelerated at that time, and by the evening, as you do. This is because many of the beliefs that you have individually and jointly are somewhat relieved in the evening, in that they so often apply to the day’s activities, when the rest of the world seems to be engaged in the nine-to-five assembly-line world experience.

You do not project as many negative ideas upon the evening hours, and the same applies to most people to varying degrees. That is at least one of the reasons why these sessions have been held in the evening, where it was at least not as likely that you would try to invest them with the workaday kind of world values.

That is also why it is easier, generally speaking, for Ruburt to receive such information in the evening, because you are jointly free of limitations that might hamper you at other times of the day — not simply that visitors might arrive more usually then, but because you yourselves are less visited by preconceptions of what you are supposed to do in any given hour of the day.

The natural, magical flows of your own rhythms are more often broken up in the daytime. This applies to other people as well, because of your ideas of what you should be doing at any given time, or what is socially respectable, proper, upright, even moral (wryly) in limited terms.

(Long pause.) You have settled upon a system that seems to be naturally based, the exclusive results of your historic past, one in which your main activities are daytime ones. It seems only natural that early man, for example, carried on all of his main activities in the day, hiding after dark. (Pause.) As a matter of fact, however, early man was a natural night dweller, and early developed the uses of fire for illumination, carrying on many activities after dark, when many natural predators slept. He also hunted very well in the dark, cleverly using all of his senses with high accuracy — the result of learning processes that are now quite lost.

(10:00.) In any case, man was not by any means exclusively a daytime creature, and fires within caves extended activities far into the night. It was agriculture that turned him more into a daytime rhythm, and for some time many beliefs lingered that resulted from earlier nighttime agricultural practices.
Many people’s natural rhythms, then, still do incline in those directions, and they are always kept operable as alternate rhythms for the species as a whole.

Ruburt has some inclinations in that direction, as do many creative people, but these rhythms are often nearly completely overlaid by culturally-learned ones. Cultures that were night-oriented (pause) appreciated the night in a different fashion, of course, and actually utilized their consciousnesses (pause) in ways that are almost nearly forgotten. I believe there are ancient fairy tales and myths still surviving that speak of these underworlds, or worlds of darkness — but they do not mean worlds of death, as is usually interpreted.

In a fashion, the intellect goes hand-in-hand with the imagination under such conditions. It is not that man stressed physical data less, but that he put it together differently — that in the darkness he relied upon his inner and outer senses in a more unified fashion. The nightly portions of your personalities have become strangers to you — for as you identify with what you think of as your rational intellect, then you identify it further with the daytime hours, with the objective world that becomes visible in the morning, with the clearcut physical objects that are then before your view.

(10:10.) In those times, however, man identified more with his intuitive self, and with his imagination, and these to some extent more than now, directed the uses to which he put his intellect.

This meant, of course, a language (pause) that was in its way more precise than your own, for concepts were routinely expressed that described the vast complexity of subjective as well as objective events. (Pause.) There were myriad relationships, for example, impossible now to describe, between a person and his or her dream selves, and between the dream selves of all the members of the tribe. Particularly in warmer climates, man was naturally nocturnal, and did a good deal of his sleeping and dreaming in the daytime.

You must remember, of course, that the use of clocks is a fairly recent phenomenon. (Pause.) Men thought in terms of rhythms of the time, or of flowing time, not of time in sections that were arbitrary. So as far as creaturehood is concerned, you have adapted to a time environment that you yourselves have formed. Creative people, again, are often aware of those connections, at least at certain levels, and Ruburt in particular has always felt that way to some extent. You have largely buried your own natural feelings in that direction.

It is up to you whether you want to call this a fill-in session or not — (“I was just going to ask you about that.”)

Those are Ruburt’s designations, not mine. Do you have a question? (“No, that was it, about the fill-in session.”)

The sessions from the beginning were based upon the natural flow of Ruburt’s energy, taking advantage of it in such a fashion.

End of session — but those rhythms are also more natural to you than you have suspected. You often have freedoms, then, that you do not use — a 24-hour period that you use quite arbitrarily, one that is already sectioned for you by society — but only if you allow it to be. It can be used in any fashion that you wish.

(“Well” I said, somewhat defensively, “I’ve always enjoyed having the sessions at night, working after supper, and so forth.”)

You barely touch the surfaces of the kind of freedom that I am speaking of, though you certainly do far better than most.

A fond good evening —
(“Thank you very much.”)
— and this is partially in response to your comments about the evening hours.

*(10:25 P.M. Jane had no idea “... what he was going to say, or anything.” And note that she did manage to have a session tonight about her own challenges, even though she was quite upset because of them at the same time. Her delivery had, in fact, often been fast and forceful.*

*(After the session I reminded Jane that she’d just given a terrific session — something that no one else could do — but that she didn’t give herself much credit for it. My remarks came about because as she sat on the couch after the session she said that she hadn’t done anything today “... but sleep and lay around. ...”)*
