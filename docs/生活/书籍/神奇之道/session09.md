THE BODY’S REASONING AS LOGIC. BELIEF SYSTEMS. 

SEPTEMBER 8, 1980 8:43 P.M., MONDAY

*(“Ijust hope I can handle it,” Jane said again. Meaning the session. “There’s so much going on in my body at one time it’s hard to handle that too,” she laughed. She referred to the continuing series of changes — improvements — taking place all through her body. At the moment these involve definite extra mobility — and soreness and itching — in her ankles and feet, for example. Right now her arms look longer, straighter. Today she’s been “pretty well out of it,” while trying to help me get through the changes we want to make in the copy-edited Mass Events. She’s helped a great deal here, writing the initial version of certain notes, which I’ll then add to before returning the manuscript to Prentice-Hall for printing.*

*(She’s also been quite restless in bed at night. When she wakes up she does exercises sometimes. I suggested she get up, but the exercises seem to substitute for the physical activity that getting up would entail.*

*(Jane yawned at 8:42: “I almost feel him around ... I guess I’ll try. ...” She sipped wine and laughed. “I think it’ll be short.”)*

Now: Good evening.
(“Good evening, Seth.”)
A brief session.

There has been one rather remarkable improvement in Ruburt’s performance: getting to his feet. That is the result of the body’s magical reasoning — for the body reasons so quickly, so clearly and concisely (pause), that its deductions, its logic, are far too fast for the intellect to follow. The body reasons directly. The body’s reasoning transforms itself into action, with nothing to stand between its elegant logic and the (pause) logic’s brilliant execution. Ruburt could not possibly follow all of the manipulations necessary so that the recent improvements could take place. Again, bodily efforts are as magical, as creative, certainly, as the writing of a book or a poem (intently) — but Ruburt in the past trusted his creative abilities as if they were something he had to guard from his physical self.

You are both finally making vital strides in understanding as a result of our last sessions in particular, and on Ruburt’s part because of the changed attitudes he has allowed, and the changed physical habits: the encouragement of motion, the expanded feeling of identity, which now includes the physical body rather than trying to exclude it.

The body is not a tool, to do your mental bidding. (Pause.) Your body is a mental expression physically materialized. More improvements are indeed even now occurring, and as long as Ruburt’s attitude continues to improve you can expect such progress — for again, the body is quite capable of healing itself completely, and with far greater ease than you give it credit for.

Ruburt did not have to do anything in particular, for example, of a conscious nature, except to state his intentions, and the body’s healing mechanisms immediately quickened. This is because he began to take the pressure off, so to speak, and really began to understand the abilities and limitations of the rational mind in its relationship to the body.

(8:59.) You both believed it was quite possible to have clairvoyant dreams, out-of-body experiences, creative adventures in the arts — but to some extent both of you doubted that the same power or energy could be directed effectively in the physical realm, so-called, of bodily health, or situations of the nitty-gritty (with emphatic amusement). Again, the material is indeed dealing with a far more valid explanation for the working ways of reality than the old official beliefs — and again, we are not just (underlined) dealing with evocative, creative hypotheses.

There is no need, then, to be surprised if some of our ideas frighten Prentice-Hall.

(“I was just going to ask you about that.”)
If our ideas were already accepted in the world, there would be no need for our work. Prentice-Hall is, of course, well-intentioned, and under their belief system it is nearly sacrilegious to be anything more than officially disapproving of medical matters. That is, some disapproval is acceptable. To attack medical corruption, or medical errors, or particular clinics, for example, is within bounds, but to attack the belief system of the entire structure is something else again.

Their objections should simply show you why our work is so important. You must not forget, again, that you both chose these challenges. You wanted to be involved with the initiation of new thematic material. You wanted the experience of getting it for yourselves, so to speak (intently) — the exhilaration of discovery.

(Softly amused:) As a matter of fact — in case you may think sometimes that I am not fully aware of your mores — I did indeed temper many of my remarks in Mass Events on several subjects, so that the book would not be found too objectionable in the context of your times. The implications are there, but your belief systems must be allowed to mellow and change in the light of new knowledge, rather than to be booted aside with an angry foot.

End of session, unless you have a question.

(“No, I was just going to ask about Prentice-Hall.”)
That is all I have to say there. They are a mainline publisher, which means that their books go to people in all walks of life — in libraries and bookstores and so forth. It is much better that the books compete in such a fashion with the other material of your times, rather than be published, say, by a specialty house, or coddled along the way, for we speak to all of those people.
Remember the last portion of this session, and your stomach need not bother you (I laughed) — or, more clearly, you will not need to bother your stomach, for that is the problem’s secret.[^1]

A fond good evening.

(“Thank you very much, Seth. Good night.”

*(9:18 P.M. “I come out, and look at my eyes,” Jane said half humorously. True, her eyes were relaxed into slits — although they gradually opened normally as we talked. “I’m glad I did that,” she said, meaning that she’d held the session, “but I really didn’t know whether I could. ...”*

*(We laughed again when we considered that Seth had tempered some of his material for Mass Events. “I’d hate to see it if he hadn’t,” Jane said.*

*(“I was so aware of my body today,” she commented, “that I wondered if I’d be aware of it during the session, but all I remember is drinking wine — which is the kind of thing I usually remember.”*
*(See the session for September 22 for our own ideas and feelings, and more of Seth’s material, on the medical/disclaimer situation with Prentice-Hall.)*



--------------NOTE: SESSION OF SEPTEMBER 8, 1980---------------



[^1]: Seth is right, of course. As I well know, I am bothering my stomach, which is perfectly innocent in its own right. I’ve reacted to stress this way before. My stomach has been knotting up because I’m stewing over the reactions of those in charge at Prentice-Hall to Seth’s material in Mass Events about medical matters.
My present uncomfortable state isn’t drastic, by any means, but it is getting my attention — which, after all, is the reason I’m creating it to begin with. Maybe I’d be better off, I told Jane, if I’d just blow my top. Only who, or what, would I direct my frustration to, or at? On the one hand Jane, Seth, and I want to see our work presented to the world as originally conceived, as a way to offer ideas to think about. On the other hand, I can visualize the dilemma those at the publisher’s feel when they’re being asked to print ideas that are, at least in part, so contrary to accepted belief structures in a very important field....
