MAGICAL ORIENTATIONS AND THE MOTIONS OF PROBABILITIES. JANE’S MENTAL CONVERSATION

SECOND ESSAY BY JANE ROBERTS: DREAMS FOR TWO AND SETH BEGINS A NEW PROJECT

August 6, 1980. So we were back at the sessions again. It took me only a few seconds to come out of trance. “Though I should stay in one,” I said, “because I was more comfortable than I’ve been all day.” Because the heat didn’t bother Seth, (or me speaking for him) at all. Returning to my usual state of consciousness I was instantly hot again.

“Well,” Rob said, “someone said a mouthful tonight.” I grinned. The crickets and wood bugs rose up in song from the summer-thick woods out back. I couldn’t remember what I’d said as Seth — and I wasn’t sure if I knew what magic was — or wasn’t — But I knew that the night was ... magical, alive with its own natural ceremonies. And that somehow the Seth sessions were as natural and right as the summer evening.

I began writing more and more poetry, quite caught up with many of the ideas that Seth was discussing. Actually I did a lot of scribbled poetry notes sitting on the side of the bed with the windows open and the fan full blast, trying to take my mind off the nearly steady 90-degree or higher temperature. Sometimes I thought that if Rob said it was a terrific day just one more time, I’d scream.

There were several other themes floating about our lives ... Sue Watkins’ new book Conversations with Seth about my E.S.P. classes was to appear in the fall. A vague uneasiness was growing in my mind: It seemed that Prentice-Hall was taking unusually long to officially clear.

The God of Jane and Seth’s The Individual and the Nature of Mass Events. I expected to hear from my editor any day. In the meantime the pesty fleas continued their household tyranny and all of this was somehow wrapped around a ribbon of excitement as we watched the Democrats and Republicans battle on the news just before we left for our respective work rooms.

Yet all of those events seemed to happen in a slightly different kind of atmosphere than before, as Seth’s ideas of the Magical Approach cast their light upon current behavior. 

Numerous but subtle instances of “magical” orientation kept appearing in our lives. We seemed to catch tiny glimpses of ordinary events before they were fully formed, and to sense the motions of probabilities invisibly but clearly stirring in the over-heated summer air. In the beginning these suggestive events just stretched our imaginations and thoughts, but later they became numerous and persistent so that we had to take them into consideration as we made normal decisions.

As with so many instances, these weren’t esoteric startling visions, but a kind of in-between event, difficult to identify, or one like the following, that was second-handed. On August 7th at supper time a young fan appeared unexpectedly at the door. I’ll call him John. Rob grinned when he saw him; John had been here twice before (once a year), he was good-humored, good-looking, eager, healthy and strong. He was engaging, and knew it. We talked to him for an hour (while, alas, dinner got cold), but he was one of those people pleasantly gifted in a variety of fields who hadn’t yet settled down to concentrate on the development of any one or two abilities in particular. He was like some kid admiring a box of chocolates; each piece representing one of his own talents, wondering which piece to nibble on first. Somewhere in the conversation, with a smiling sense of wonder, he told us what had happened as he drove through Elmira on the way to our house.

As he drove into town ... he saw on the street a girl who looked familiar. No wonder — he’d met her at a bar the first time he was in town. “I’ve only been in this town twice, when I visited you before,” he said. “Yet earlier tonight driving down a street I suddenly recognized a girl who looked familiar. I slowed the car and looked. She was walking on the sidewalk, and sure enough, it was the same girl I’d met at a bar during my first trip to Elmira. I could hardly believe it, but I stopped the car and we talked awhile. She remembered me at once. So the chances of that kind of meeting must be astronomical.” She had told him he could stay at her place overnight. Coincidence? We only spoke to him for an hour, and he said he had wondered earlier what he’d do with the whole evening ... so what exactly happened at the magical level of activity?

The same night I had an experience with a mental conversation [that turned out to be precognitive].1 I think both instances represent activity and communication ... at the magical level. They represent a kind of mobility ... a psychological motion, at another level than the usually conscious one.

Our next scheduled Seth session was for the following Monday — another day high in the 90s, and I found myself anticipatory and hopeful: Would Seth discuss some of those issues? I felt again that an entire new “package” of session material was coming our way — and I wanted to be able to put it to practical use. See the second session, with an edited version of Rob’s notes, deleting only highly personal material.
