**MAGIC SHOW**

What magicians we all are, 

turning darkness into light, 

transforming invisible atoms 

into the dazzling theater

of the world, 

pulling objects, (people as well as rabbits)

out of secret

microscopic closets,

turning winter into summer, 

making a palmful of moments 

disappear through time’s trap door.

We learned the methods

so long ago

that they’re unconscious,

and we’ve hypnotized ourselves into believing

that we’re the audience,

so I wonder where we served

our apprenticeship.

Under what master magicians did we learn 

to form reality

so smoothly that we forgot to tell ourselves 

the secret?



—— *Jane Roberts, 1979*



##### **FOREWORD**

My wife, Jane Roberts, dictated *The Magical Approach* for Seth, the “energy personality essence” she spoke for in a trance state, in 1980— but the pressures of Jane’s illness, and of our producing other books, kept us from publishing it quickly. Then Jane died in 1984, at the age of 55. I was 65. Looking back from my position within the framework of simultaneous time, I’m amazed to see that another ten years passed before the publication of this little book by Amber-Allen/New World Library. Why the delay? What happened? Janet Mills, the publisher and editor for the new editions of Jane’s books, suggested that I write a bit about the situation. Many others have asked over the years, and I’m very grateful for every one of those caring questions.

I know what happened, and yet consciously I’ll never grasp all of the psychic ramifications involved. The day after Jane died I went back to work, finishing the last two Seth books to meet long-overdue publishing deadlines. Jane’s and my dear friend, Debbie Harris, began making copies of all of the Seth sessions, plus the transcripts of Jane’s ESP classes, for the “collection” of Jane’s and my work in the archives of Yale University Library. But while I kept myself busy, and presented a smiling face to the world, I was numb inside. I cried for my wife several times a day for a year. Even though it’s simultaneous, according to Seth, I needed “time” for my long journey of recovery.

Jane and I had corresponded with Laurel Lee Davies for several years. Five months after my wife’s death, I called Laurel, who was an administrative assistant at a center for the arts and humanities in Los Angeles, California, for the first time. As the many hours of our calls quickly accumulated, Laurel and I came to understand through dreams that we had shared reincarnational relationships. In August of that year — 1985 — she moved to Elmira to work with me in a number of ways. She helped me carry on the massive project of continuing the work that Debbie Harris had begun: copying many more of the thousands of pages of Jane’s and my work for the archives of the library at Yale. She answered mail, and put together a mailing list. She helped me proofread *Seth, Dreams, and Projection of Consciousness* for Stillpoint Publishing. Later, she helped me proofread the new editions of *Seth Speaks* and *The Nature of Personal Reality* that Amber-Allen/New World Library has published. She’s worked as a researcher of Jane’s material for *The Magical Approach* — the book she has “most dreamed of working on.” Laurel has been Seth’s “metaphysical apprentice,” as she recently put it, for fourteen years now. Even with our differences, our supportive and complicated relationship continues. Yet even so, as the years passed I began to better see that recovery from Jane’s death was going to take the rest of my life; and that within the framework of simultaneous time uncounted millions of others had experienced that truth, were doing so now, and would be doing so. Maybe some day I’ll write in detail about Jane’s and my lives — but not now!

Other than a few close friends — Sue Watkins among them — I saw few people. Sue is mentioned in *The Magical Approach*. So is Tam Mossman, Jane’s editor at Prentice-Hall. Tam was a great help in a number of ways. Beginning with the Spring 1985 issue, Tam published his very interesting quarterly, *Metapsychology: The Journal of Discarnate Intelligence*, for several years. He included Seth material in many issues. In the meantime I’d gone back to painting, which I’d given up for the last two years of Jane’s life. I painted portraits of her as I met her in my dreams. I did no writing except for the “grief notebooks” that I composed about Jane’s passing and my reactions to that event. Deliberate therapy, some of that.

Our beloved books began to go out of print, one by one, as sales slowly declined. I thought the letters from readers would also slack off. They did to some extent — but to my surprise and pleasure they continued to arrive at that slower but steady pace. I tried hard to answer each one of them. (I still do, although at this writing I’m far behind. I’ve let answering any but immediate business mail go while Laurel and I worked on the manuscript for *The Magical Approach.)*

For several years after Jane’s death, I explored possible publishing ventures with old and trusted friends — people who, like Richard Kendall and Suzanne Delisle, sincerely wanted to see Jane’s and my work kept in print. Richard had been a member of Jane’s ESP class in the 1970s. Following her passing, as a paralegal he was also a great help in resolving some old and troublesome publishing hassles. At the same time, I wondered often if it was of any use to try publishing Seth books, old or new — why do so, if sales were falling? Maybe people were tired of the Seth material. Maybe Jane and I had already offered the best we could, for whatever our efforts were worth. The world would certainly go on, regardless.

Our books continued to go out of print, and in 1990 I began working with Anne Marie O’Farrell, a literary agent. She’s married to Rick Stack, a writer, publisher, and lecturer involving things psychic; he too was a member of ESP class. Without Anne Marie’s untiring help, I question whether I’d still be in publishing. For she “found” Janet Mills and Amber-Allen/New World Library. Like Laurel, both women are passionately interested in keeping Jane’s work in print. Janet told me, after publishing the first two reprints, that she “would like to publish all of the books at once.” And added that she was already getting requests to do just that.

In 1993, I saw the culmination of three ventures that I’d been involved in for varying periods of time: Lynda Dahl and Stan Ulkowski, of Seth Network International, published the first quarterly issue of the newly expanded Seth-oriented magazine, *Reality Change. (RC*, as everyone calls it, was founded by Maude Cardwell in June 1980; she began it as a two-page mimeographed newsletter.) Richard Roberts, of Vernal Equinox Press, published *A Seth Reader*, a volume consisting of excerpts from six of the Seth books. And Bob Terrio, of Bob Terrio Productions, marketed a video, *The Seth Phenomena*, in which I discuss Jane’s and my work.

I’m still not finished with the duplication of Jane’s and my papers for Yale University Library. Indeed, that long-range endeavor doesn’t have to have a discrete end. I’ve learned that there will always be more to add to the collection.

For some time now Rick Stack and I have discussed a most intriguing project: the private printing, by Rick, of the complete transcripts of those first 510 sessions that Jane held before the publication of *The Seth Material in* 1970. This will be a massive job. The set of eight volumes will be called *The Early Sessions*, and will be sold by subscription only, at least in the beginning.

Sue Watkins, who described Jane’s ESP class so well in her two- volume *Conversations with Seth*, recently began doing research for *Conversations with Jane Roberts: A Multidimensional Memoir*.

I’m very fortunate that the help of all of those I’ve mentioned, and of others, too, is enabling me to keep the promise I made to Jane on her deathbed ten years ago, when she asked me to publish all of her work. I know that my wife lives within me now, as I do within her “where she is now” — just as we shared ourselves with each other throughout the nearly twenty-nine years of our marriage. That simultaneous time passed with unbelievable depth and swiftness.

Life goes on, then, only it’s different. Of course my feelings, while being unique in that they’re my own, are intimately bound up with those of everyone else. How could it be otherwise, since no one can live in true isolation? Each one of us is an immortal portion, a spark of endless perception and beauty and feeling — and yes, of conflict and denial at times — within this probable reality that we’re all creating together, even when we don’t know we’re doing it! I watch with awe as within this reality each one of us expresses as best we can our creative understanding of this wonderful mystery.

##### INTRODUCTION

A DAY INWHICH MAGIC COMES TO LIFE AND SETH DESCRIBES WHAT THE
MAGICAL APPROACH TO LIFE IS
BY JANE ROBERTS

Twice a week when evening comes (as most of my readers know) while our neighbors go to movies, or shopping plazas, or just have friends in to watch television, I go into a trance,[^1] “become” Seth, and take on a kind of a second life, or a life within a life. Actually, the sessions usually last anywhere from one to three hours, so I suppose that many people spend a good deal more time than that playing golf or tennis.

In our case though, Rob and I usually have no direct audience (not that we can see anyhow), and those few hours spent in trance have an impact on my husband and me — and upon the world — out of context with the actual time expended.

As Seth I’ve produced five previous books: *Seth Speaks; The Nature of Personal Reality; The* *“Unknown”* *Reality, Volumes I and II; The Nature of the Psyche;* and *The Individual and the Nature of Mass Events*, and Seth is halfway through a sixth book: *Dreams,* *“Evolution,”* *and Value Fulfillment*. These beside my own twelve books. Seth doesn’t answer mail though, or do any typing, and so as a result of those trance hours Rob and I spend a good deal of our conscious energy dealing one way or another with the effects of that trance life.

In the summer of 1980 I missed Seth sessions for nearly two months. I was finishing work on one of my own books, *The God of Jane*. Rob was preparing Seth’s *The Individual and the Nature of Mass Events* for publication. We were both caught up in the same events as most other people were during that June and July — the hotter-than-usual nights and days, the drought in parts of New York State that touched our area lightly, the TV news drama as the political parties argued and planned for their conventions. Some nights the (singing) bugs in the small back woods were louder than the sound of our television set. The same heat that made me groan with dismay turned Rob into some version of a south-sea island native. He looked supercool in his cut-off denim shorts; his long hair curled into natural corkscrews, his light durable frame seeming to luxuriate in the heat while my light durable frame turned into a sponge that added ten pounds of fatigue.

I was between projects after *The God of Jane*. In the meantime I’d read over the 17 chapters of my unfinished novel, *Oversoul Seven and the Museum of Time*, and looked over groups of notes for possible books, but nothing hit the spot. I asked for some ideas from my “natural spontaneous self,” and on August 5, 1980, I dreamed that a moving van with me in it was itself being moved by a larger vehicle ahead of some planned time. There was a squabble over seating arrangements which was finally resolved. I took that to mean that I would shortly be on the move again creatively, and to be prepared, so I had Rob help me move all my writing materials from the small breezeway where I’d finished *The God of Jane*, into the new patio back room, as a gesture of being ready to start over.

So on August 6th I sat in the patio-room with fresh paper, fresh typewriter cartridge, and hopefully fresh mind, looking over my interpretations of Rob’s latest dreams. It was a very hot August afternoon. The pieces of the world fell neatly into their proper places. The pictures of the moments clicked together as they usually do, each instant precise, yet leading into another. The motion seemed to be all exterior, from the too-warm wind that blew into my small studio from the back hill, to the shadows of moving foliage outside that flickered across the floor.

I was glancing at one of several pages of notes that Rob had written. At the lunch table I had remarked that a particular correspondent of ours wanted “instant magic,” and my comment led to Rob writing some notes. As I started to read these notes at random this particular portion caught my attention ... Rob wrote:

> Magic as we call it represents (reflects) a basic part of our natural heritage ... We permit distorted versions of the psyche’s attributes — clairvoyant, telepathic, and precognitive abilities — which surface as magic. [^2]

Something in his words struck me in a new fashion. Rob and I often discussed such subjects. He was saying that we were immersed in “magic” no matter what we called it, that manifestations of telepathy, and so forth, were just places where our magic “showed.” For some reason as I finished reading ... I felt inspired. Or rather, I felt an inner psychological motion happening — a movement as definite, yet subtle as the shadows that flickered on the floor. A change of balance — a vital but usually-hidden psychic action that instantly changed me and the afternoon.

As I recognized the feeling of inspiration, I glanced idly toward the kitchen. The sight of the table struck my fancy, plus my view of the front doorway, with the green foliage showing through the open threshold. I thought about doing another painting of the scene; I hadn’t done any painting in months. Then I thought of asking Rob to take a snapshot of the table area, so that I could paint it later. Not two minutes passed before Rob stood at my door with his camera! He’d bought a flash gadget several months ago to use with it, and he hadn’t tried it out yet. Now he told me he had one exposure left, and he wanted to take a snapshot of me to use it up.

He had been fussing with the camera at the other end of the house from the den. There was no way, I thought, that I could have picked up physical clues as to his activity. Yet here he stood, camera and all.

My feelings “clicked;” the incident was significant; and it seemed to fit in too perfectly and meaningfully into the events just previous, as if saying “yes, you do operate magically” ... and this is an example of how those perceptions work. If Rob hadn’t come in at that point, I wouldn’t have known that my thought about cameras had anything to do with his thoughts or activities at the same time. So how often do our thoughts relate in one way or another to the thoughts of others?[^3]

I told Rob what I’d been thinking just before he came in. My hunch is that because of my state of mind — interpreting Rob’s dreams, and my reading of his notes, I was in a particular kind of correspondence with him, or with his state of mind, that facilitated the inner communication. We talked about it.

Suddenly I had a whole bunch of thoughts that I wanted to write up regarding this ... “magical orientation” Rob was speaking of. Seth’s “Framework 2” would be this magical area, of course, I thought. Yet except for the beginning of that (part) of Seth’s material, Framework 2[^4] never really got through to me emotionally. Somehow Rob’s few notes did, or maybe I was just ready. The magical orientation to reality would include intellectual activity. That went without saying, but the way of relating to life would be completely different too; the way of dealing with problems or health difficulties; of achieving goals and so forth would be drastically different. The word “action” would mean something else than it does, too.

Rob’s notes helped me realize that all of this wasn’t as alien as it usually seems. The magical orientation might be in direct conflict with our training in this and most present cultures. But it would be part of our natural way of looking at the world — a way that has been overlaid by our belief in the “rational” way of doing things. That way was proving to be not so rational at all, incidently. But I thought there would be things in each person’s life that could be used as guideposts, to a magical kind of orientation. ...

I took the fan into the bedroom, the coolest room in the house, sat down on the edge of the bed, and began to write down my own feelings about Rob’s notes (and) the camera affair — and what I called the Magical Connection.

Heat or no, I had to notice that the room seemed plunged into greenness — the leaves trembling and the fir tree so close to the window that a branch could grow in if you left the window open long enough.

As I wrote the fan whirred, stirring the air against my skin as the green leaves winked — and I felt a trance at last entering the neighborhood of my mind. Seth, I knew, would start up the sessions again that night — if I wanted to. ...[^5]

I grinned. I wanted to. Yet after the two-month layoff I was nervous too; as I always was after any extended “trance vacation.” Suppose — just suppose — I couldn’t start up again or I lost the knack as suddenly as I’d acquired it (17 years before)? Or Seth spoke gibberish? I didn’t really worry that such things might happen, but I was uneasily aware that they could. “Nonsense,” I muttered, “it’s the heat!” Because I knew that Seth would speak about the magical “connection.” I managed another grin — and who should know more about “magic” than Seth? Didn’t he emerge magically to begin with?

Around 4:00 the temperature hit 92 degrees and I thought of putting the session off. Rob and I took an hour’s nap, though, and ate supper at the coffee table while watching the evening news. I wiggled around a lot trying to get comfortable while the “cool as a cucumber” Rob said what a great day it was. And finally, just after 8:30 I began to feel Seth around.

It was okay. After the layoff, there was Seth poised psychologically once again (for over the thousandth time). At the threshold of my mind those “psychic gears” turned. Rob was ready with his notebook and pen. I took a sip of my wine and ice. The fan whirred. A slightly cool breeze came in through the open doors and windows. Then I took off my glasses, “turned into” Seth, and began to speak. Bare legs propped up on the coffee table Rob sat, pen poised, and the session started.



NOTES: INTRODUCTION BY JANE ROBERTS

[^1]: Jane Roberts writes in *The God of Jane:* “Since late 1963, I’ve clocked approximately 4,000 hours of trancetime, during which the Seth sessions have been held twice weekly. ... My trancetime is more concentrated than regular time. I’m not unconscious but conscious in a different way, at another level ... This state of perception has nothing to do with classical pathological dissociation; and its products — Seth’s five books — display a highly-developed intellect at work and give evidence of a special kind of creativity. In those trance hours I ‘turn into someone else.’ At least I am not myself to myself; I become Seth, or a part of what Seth is. I don’t feel ‘possessed’ or ‘invaded’ during sessions. I don’t feel that some superspirit has ‘taken over’ my body. Instead it’s as if I’m practicing some precise psychological art, one that is ancient and poorly understood in our culture; or as if I’m learning a psychological science that helps me map the contours of consciousness itself ... after all this time, I’m finally examining the trance view of reality and comparing it to the official views of science and religion. ...

“This is almost always an exhilarating experience, like riding some perfect gigantic ninth wave of energy, knowing exactly how and when to ‘jump in’, and feeling absolutely safe and supported even when embarked upon such a strange psychological flight. But the energy and power of *this* wave carries me above and below usual reality, sweeping me into contrasts that are microscopic and macroscopic by turns.”
