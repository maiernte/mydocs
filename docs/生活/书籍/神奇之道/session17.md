JANE’S SKILL AS ANCIENT AS MAN IS. THE SPECIES’ MULTITUDINOUS ABILITIES. 

OCTOBER 15, 1980 8:55 P.M., WEDNESDAY

*(At lunch today I read the latest group of poems Jane has prepared for her book of poetry for Prentice-Hall.[^1]*

*(The second game of the World Series started at 8:30 — I think — tonight, although I hardly glanced at it on television as we made ready for the session; the set went off after the first [scoreless] inning anyhow. I had a letter half done for Jeanne Miles, my well-known artist friend who lives in New York City. Mitzi was chasing one of her paperfoil toys down the cellar stairs. ...*

*(I’d just finished typing the last few pages for Monday night’s session, and I asked Jane what she thought of my final note: I’d speculated about any reincarnational connections that might tie her abilities to speak for Seth, without help of any modern kind, to the abilities ancient man had displayed, when, according to Seth, he’d been able to carry all of his history with him mentally. As ancient man had lived without the news media we’re so used to, so does Jane speak for Seth without all of that modern help. I hadn’t expected Seth to go into related material this evening.)*

Good evening.
(“Good evening, Seth.”)

Now: Ruburt’s skill is as ancient as man is, and indeed all of your arts, sciences, and cultural achievements are the offshoots of (pause) spontaneous mental and biological processes.
(Pause, one of many.) I choose my words quite carefully at times, because I realize the various interpretations that can be placed upon them. Perhaps the following explanation will express more clearly what I mean.

In the first place, as often mentioned lately, the reasoning mind is spontaneously fired. The species contains within itself all of the necessary spontaneous attributes that are necessary to form a civilization, for example. (Pause.) All of your reasoned activities — your governments, societies, arts, religions and sciences — are the physical realization, of course, of inner capacities, capacities that are inherent in man’s structure. Take your theaters’ moving picture dramas. These are the materialization in your time of man’s natural acting ability — a characteristic highly important in the behavior of the species.

Early man, for example, spontaneously played at acting out the part of other animals. He took the part of a tree, a brook, a rock. Acting became a teaching method — a way of passing on information. (Long pause.) Man always possessed all of the knowledge he needed. The task was to make it physically available.

People like Ruburt translated inner knowledge in many ways — through acting it out, through singing or dancing, through drawing images on cave walls. It was the intellect’s job to put such information to practical use, and thus the intuitions and the intellect worked hand in hand. 

(Long pause.) Man dealt then with spontaneous knowing in a more direct fashion.

(Pause at 9:10.) It is very difficult to try to explain the various shadings of psychology that were involved. Early man did act in a more spontaneous manner, more automatically, in your terms, but not mindlessly. If you remember the early portions of our latest book (Mass Events), then this information should fall into place, for consciousness emerged from the inside outward. Animals enjoy drama, and in their fashions they playact.

It was left to man to translate his inner information with a free hand. He is able to form many different kinds of cultures, for example. He puts his sciences and religions, his languages, together in multitudinous ways, but there must always be a translation of inner information outward to the world of sense. There still is. Man’s capacities have not dimmed in that regard. Thinking, for example, is as automatic as ever (amused). It is simply that your culture puts the various elements together in ways that stress the qualities of what you refer to as rational thinking.

When the species needs certain abilities, they rise to the fore, as in the case of Ruburt now. 

When you are painting pictures you are also translating inner knowledge. Early artists drew pictures to share the images they saw in their dreams. In a fashion they practiced dreaming in their sleep, and thus learned also to think (underlined) in terms of the measurement of physical images, and to move objects around in their minds before they did so physically.

Poetry was an art and a science. It conveyed quite necessary information about man and the universe. The same can be said of many cave drawings. What you had — what you still have, though you are not nearly as aware of it — was an excellent give-and-take between the inner and outer senses. Through chanting, dancing, playacting, painting, story-telling, man spontaneously translated inner sense data into physical actualization. The physical senses only present you with clues as to your own sensitivities.

Ruburt translates what I give him without being consciously aware of receiving the material in usual terms, or of translating it. It has to be broken down, particularly to a time frame, and then into concepts that can take advantage of the world view that is held in your culture. 

Everything must be slanted to fit the viewpoint of creatures who believe most firmly in the superiority of matter over mind — who are immersed in a particular biological framework.
(9:27.) I cannot ignore those belief structures (intently) — or what I say would literally be incomprehensible. All of this is automatically taken care of.

(Long pause.) Now: The species has multitudinous abilities, each necessary, each adding to the entire fulfillment and attributes of your people. Some individuals choose to specialize, following specific lines of abilities throughout many existences — accommodating these, however, to the times in which they are born. Both of you have been speakers in that regard. The methods may change. You may “speak” through art or music, through trance activities, but you will specialize in the use of the inner senses, and in translating the inner knowledge of the species, bringing it to whatever level of ordinary consciousness that is considered the official one.

(Long pause at 9:35.) You know what sound is, yet as Ruburt knows, what you consider sound is only one of sound’s many spectrums. Beside translating inner images into paintings, for example, you may unknowingly be translating sensually invisible sounds into images. In a way quite impossible to describe, it would be true to say that our sessions actually translate multidimensional images into words. You have no words for the kinds of images I am speaking of, for they are not objects, nor pictures of objects, nor images of images, but instead the inner dimensions, each separate and glowing, but connected, prisms of knowledge, that have within themselves more reality than you can presently begin to imagine.

To a certain extent, I must travel from those realities into your comprehension, wrest myself free in order to form an ever-changing, ever-moving, ever-on-the-move entity that can speak here and be there at the same time. So I am distant and close at once. That distance from you also represents the reaches, however, of the human psyche, and the vast corridors of psychological activity from which it is formed, and from which your world emerges.

For the worlds are so composed that each one is a part of each other one, and there is no disconnecting. There is no place or space, psychological, psychic, where those worlds exist apart from each other, so you cannot say that one is more highly evolved than another.

(Long pause at 9:45.) There are as many frontiers as there ever were, and there is no catastrophe that will annihilate consciousness, or put an end to earthly life. When you think in terms of earth’s destruction, or the ending of the world, you are thinking of course of a continuum of time, and of beginnings and endings. From your viewpoint in space and time, it seems that planets have come and gone, stars collapsed, and when you look outward into space, it appears (underlined) that you look backward into time. (Long pause.) There are great pulsations, however, in existence — pulsations that have nothing to do with time as you understand it, but with intensities.

In the deepest of terms, the world always was and always will be. It changes its patterns of activity, it comes and goes, but it is always itself in its comings and goings. To me, that is exceedingly simple — but as far as your concepts are concerned, it can seem to imply irreconcilable complications.

End of session. A small note to our friend — again — to trust the great power of the universe that forms his own image, to trust his spontaneity, and his body’s natural urges toward relaxation, motion, and creativity, as these show themselves in their own rhythms.
A dear and cozy good evening to you in your sweet house — with (amused) the baseball game ahead of you, and all of the loving paraphernalia that is so specific in your space and time.

(“Thank you, Seth. Good night.”

*(9:56 P.M. “Boy, I was out with that,” Jane said. “That really hits me: you can tell you’re out there so far, with all of this energy, but you can’t go any further, you know what I mean? At the same time, it’s so simple... It was a different session in some way. My feelings are that I was different, although I don’t know about what different things you might get down. Right now I’m looking at the clock — and it seems that you were so far away that it seems I should take four hours to get back. Not that I had any sense of time in the session. ...”*

*(The session is indeed an excellent one, and Jane’s delivery, after a slow start, had often been intent and inspired.)*

------------NOTE: SESSION OF OCTOBER 15, 1980--------------

[^1]: Jane called her book of poetry If We Live Again: Or, Public Magic and Private Love, and Prentice-Hall published it in 1982.
Poetry was her first, childhood love, and it remained a powerful creative factor throughout her life. Indeed, in some of her earliest poetry we found concepts that Seth was to elaborate upon many years later. As Seth told us in 1979, Jane had been a poet all of the time, in its most profound meaning. She’d been letting If We Live Again grow for some time as she selected poems for it from the many she had written, and kept writing.
Jane also wrote three introductory essays for the book. Here are her opening lines from the first essay, “Poetry and the Magical Approach to Life”:
“To me at least, poetry — like love — implies a magical approach to life, quite different from the presently accepted rational way of looking at the world. That is, poetry brings out life’s hidden nuances. It delights in forming correspondences between events that seem quite separate to the intellectually-tuned consciousness alone, and reveals undercurrents of usually-concealed actions that we quite ignore when we’re most concerned about thinking rationally. Actually, that kind of vision contains its own spontaneous rationality, and often supplies us with answers more satisfying than purely intellectual ones.”
