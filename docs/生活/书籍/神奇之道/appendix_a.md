THREE OF JANE’S ADVENTURES IN PREDICTION. SETH COMMENTS. JANE’S

This appendix contains three of Jane Roberts’ (unfinished) essays on different kinds of “prediction” and precognition experience. Also included is one excerpt by Seth about Jane’s talents with a similar kind of experience.

Jane discusses “prediction” and precognition in her books: How to Develop Your ESP Power, Adventures in Consciousness, Psychic Politics, and The God of Jane.

She wrote these essays in 1980 and 1981. They were taken from her journals and edited as little as possible to preserve her original spirit. Jane usually wrote several drafts for her “own” books, but spoke her books by Seth in final draft form.

(May 1980) This small incident fascinated me.

Wednesday night after the Seth session, before bed, I suddenly began to wonder if the paintings Rob had sold to Lib’s Supper Club, back in the 60s, were still there.

Rob and I started talking about them as I sat on the bed, and we got ready to retire. I remembered and described three of them, thought there was a fourth, but couldn’t remember it. This is the first time we’ve discussed those paintings in ... ten years?

I completely forgot our discussion until last night, Friday, when the Gallaghers [our dear friends, Peg and Bill] visited. In a lull of conversation, Peg G. leaned forward and said: “I was at Lib’s Supper Club, and your paintings are still there,” or other words to that effect,  mentioning both Lib’s and the paintings.

I felt a small sense of shock. My eyes leapt to Rob’s — I could see he felt the same way. Then Peg told us that Wednesday evening, though earlier than (Rob’s and my) discussion, she’d asked someone to check the signature, and saw that they were indeed Rob’s.

This is the first time since the sixties that the Gallaghers have ever mentioned those paintings to us also; although they’ve been to Lib’s many times in those years ... It’s also interesting that Peg didn’t see the fourth painting, either ... She and I seem to “pick up” from each other fairly well, according to past instances...

If she hadn’t mentioned her visit to Lib’s, and the paintings, Rob and I never would have realized that anything beyond usual perception was operating in our little discussion. And the discussion was ... extremely clear in my mind.

So how may times does this kind of thing happen? What cross-currents of perception operate? What kinds of data do we pick up on — and why?

Rob and I can’t be sure whether our discussion was Wednesday or Tuesday night. Wednesday was the night Peg G. visited Lib’s, and saw the paintings.

If our discussion actually happened Tuesday, before Peg’s visit (which was planned ahead of time), then we run into other possibilities than if our discussion was on Wednesday ... (as we thought).

On Wednesday I must have picked up on Peg’s visit earlier that same evening; her visit to Lib’s, her specific interest in the paintings. She asked someone to check the name because she wasn’t sure they were Rob’s work. Then later that night, relaxed, sitting on the bed, somehow those inner perceptions (of mine) would have surfaced ... but without revealing their source. I can’t remember why I began the discussion, for example. So exactly what unconscious processing went on?

Why didn’t Rob pick up the inner information and begin the discussion instead of me, since they’re his paintings? And how many times do we do this, invisibly winding such data into the fabric of our perceptions, reacting to it without even realizing it?

If Rob and I discussed it on Tuesday, I could have picked up on Peg’s plan to go to Lib’s, wondered about Rob’s paintings — and have somehow gotten my question across to her. So that, visiting the next night, she was attracted to the paintings, answering my question Friday when she gave us her account of the episode.

All of this reminds me of my old idea of a projected book: The Contents of the Mind, or the Unofficial Contents of the Mind. After reading this first page of notes about Peg G. and the paintings, I remember my old ideas ... that we organize the contents of our minds along certain lines that then become habitual.

We’re both highly interested in Rob’s paintings, for instance, so of course I picked up on that kind of data from Peg. I’ve organized data with the focus of art in mind as a focus point through which to ... perceive the world.

The idea is to be alert for psychological contents of the mind that we usually ignore, that science can’t prove or disprove ... where we take experience over theory.

This is another classic example of an event that science would label simply “coincidental” without being able to give any objective proof to back up its contention.

The “natural” subjective experience — the feelings involved — give the opposite explanation. 

They insist that more than coincidence is involved — that the event is significant.

And in such cases we have every right to go with direct experience and our feelings.

Too often (Jane writes) we just want to go full steam ahead — we want sublime visions. But here, in these subtle (byways) of subjective action, we very well might be seeing some of these hidden psychic motions upon which physical events rest ... and how today’s events and last year’s rub against each other like leaves from the same tree. And how Seth’s sessions of last August seem to apply newly to today’s events. How sneaky and obvious it all is at the same time.

Today before I began work, for instance, I scribbled down ten quick phrases under the heading “Predictions: August 24, 1981.” This took perhaps three minutes or so. [Presented exactly as written by Jane.]

Predictions — Monday, August 24, 1981 — Noon — Jane Roberts
1. Snow ball machine
2. Engagement once dropped re-scheduled
3. Egg carton
4. Prominent triangle — maybe gift.
5. Snow shoes?
6. Boxed-in canyon
7. Milk man
8. detective
9. Stove comes earlier.
10. double digit series

Around 1:00 P.M., as Rob and I finished lunch in the kitchen and waited for the mailman, a fan turned up. A young lad who usually showed up once a year. He was the one I described in The God of Jane who felt himself to be a woman trapped in a man’s body. He has some suicidal tendencies, and I’ve worried about that. But here he was, all grins this time ... alive and several pounds more substantial.

Rob had to go to the bank, so he excused himself and left just after the mailman arrived. I read the mail over. This year’s cool August air blew through the house, and I tightened my sweater. One letter in particular caught my eyes because it was from an old friend, Ed, the man who had introduced Rob and I to begin with; a man who we had lost touch with until two years ago when he’d suddenly written from Alaska.

So as I listened to our visitor (I’ll call him Larry) talk, I browsed through the letter. My thoughts went back to the years when Ed and Rob produced the detective comic strip Mike Hammer together with Micky Spillane. Then I thought of Ed’s first letter of two years ago, breaking a twenty-year-old silence, mailed from Alaska where Ed was skiing. In fact, the letter before me mentioned the Alaskan ski trip. That might have been the reference that suddenly gave me small shivers.

Larry was telling me that he had a new job, running the cash register at a convenient grocery store, and I nodded but the (shivery) feeling persisted till the next moment when I checked my predictions.

Some now made perfect sense. I circled numbers 1, 5 and 8 (see prediction listing) which read: “Snow ball machine, snowshoes, detective.” Surely they all applied to Ed’s letter in which he mentioned his Alaskan ski trip, and friends he had when he and Rob did the detective comic strip.

The letter itself had been in the mailman’s truck when I made my morning’s predictions.

The predictions weren’t the greatest, but they had a satisfying feel. I figured that “snow ball machine” and “snow shoes” were my interpretations to describe any snow equipment. Besides skiing Ed probably used a snowmobile and snowshoes. So I granted them as fair- enough predictions, particularly in summertime when normal associations didn’t usually involve snow. I also granted a “fair” prediction to “detective.”

My eyes scanned the list. Could 3 and 7 — egg carton and milk man — apply to Larry’s grocery store job? These I just marked evocative. Then I thought of another connection with “milk man” — our young fan, Larry, once would only drink milk, he was on a natural food diet — or had been. In fact, I had offered him milk as I went over my predictions ... I suddenly remembered something else. That morning before beginning work, I sat at my desk unaccountably thinking about the way Rob and I had met. I had the impulse, for no particular reason, to write about the meeting today instead of writing on this book (The Magical Approach) and spent a good ten minutes thinking about the entire affair. In memory’s quick vivid images I saw the very first meeting:

Spring night; my first husband and I just pulled up in front of my mother’s house; the rushing sounds of a car pulling in ahead of us. Ed Robinson’s voice — the Ed of the Alaskan letter now received thirty years later, (the Ed who was then doing the detective comic strip referred to in the day’s predictions) and a stranger’s voice.

The stranger who bent his head to our car window was Rob. Ed had recognized my husband’s car and followed us, asking us to go to his house to meet his new work partner, Rob, when I was finished visiting with my mother.

All of that came to mind this morning; not that it couldn’t have just been “coincidence” that later in the day I hear from Ed — after making three predictions that seemed to apply to him. But surely there is a point where feelings themselves are meanings; where the heart’s evidence recognizes intuitively what the intellect must question. And I know that those memories and thoughts were connected with my later predictions and Ed’s letter in the noon mail. I’d been reacting to Ed’s letter before its arrival.

(“Results”)
1, 5: In today’s mail letter from Ed Robinson — Probably our 3rd?

*Anyhow — after 20 years we heard from him in 1978 — from Alaska — skiing from Alaska Back Country — he mentions Alaska skiing today. When we knew Ed Robinson — over 20 years ago — he was doing Mike Hammer comic strip for Micky Spillane. Rob joined him and that’s what he was doing when I met him (Rob).

*Note: Early A.M. I think about writing today about first meeting Rob — though I’m working on Chapter Two of Magical Approach! Surprised by the impulse — then forget it.

3, 7: Just note. Evocative but not definite enough. A fan (Larry), here from Pennsylvania, says he has a new 2nd job — in grocery chain convenient market (that sells basics — nothing fancy; eggs, milk, beer, etc.). Larry drinks only milk (at one time).



2.Note: Monday, August 24. “Floyd” said he’d be here this afternoon. After not appearing on job for days. About 12:30 he calls, can’t make it — again — supposedly will come tomorrow.

The next morning, Tuesday, August 25, 1981, I scribbled down another short list of predictions. Reading them back I read “old friend, Auld Lang Syne.” Not likely, I thought, just after hearing from one old friend. Remembering the Ed affair of yesterday, I thought ironically this must be old friend week.

And, in a way it was. The stove we bought this week was delivered. One of the delivery men from Sears recognized Rob and I at once as a couple he had known briefly in the sixties, when we often visited with the Maples (old friends who — again — we haven’t heard from in 20 years) who he had lived downstairs from.

And a kind of ghostly elegance was added Thursday when another old friend visited and showed us color slides taken in London on Xmas/New Years, 1980, and mentioned they all chimed in to sing “Auld Lang Syne.”

I get the feeling that events are getting knocked into and out of prominence all the time! But catching the motion is something else again. [Presented exactly as written by Jane.]

Seth describes another sort of prediction experience of Jane’s in Volume II of Dreams, “Evolution” and Value Fulfillment. From the 932nd session, which she held on August 4, 1981:

“... One morning last weekend (Saturday) Ruburt [Jane] found himself suddenly and vividly thinking about some married friends. They lived out of town, separated in time by a drive of approximately (half an hour). Ruburt found himself wishing that the friends lived closer, and he was suddenly filled with a desire to see them. He imagined the couple at the house, and surprised himself by thinking that he might indeed call them later in the day and invite them down for the evening, even though she and Joseph [Rob] had both decided against guests that weekend.

Furthermore, Ruburt did not like the idea of making an invitation on such short notice. Then he became aware that those particular thoughts were intrusive, completely out of context with his immediately previous ones, for only a moment or so earlier he had been congratulating himself precisely because he had made no plans for the day or evening at all ... about fifteen minutes later he found the same ideas returning, this time more insistently.

They lasted perhaps five minutes. Ruburt noticed them and forgot them once again. This time, however, he decided not to call his friends, and he went about his business. In about a half hour the same mental activity returned, and finding himself struck by this, he mentioned the episode to Joseph and again cast it from his mind.

By this time it was somewhat later in the day. Ruburt and Joseph ate lunch, and the mail arrived. There was a letter written the morning before (on Friday) by the same friends that had been so much in Ruburt’s mind. They mentioned going on a trip (on Saturday), and specifically asked if they could visit that same afternoon. From the way the letter was written, it seemed as if the friends — call them Peter and Polly — had already started on their journey that (Saturday) morning, and would stop in Elmira on their return much later toward evening. There was no time to answer the letter, of course.

... It would be simple enough, of course, to ascribe Ruburt’s thoughts and feelings to mere coincidence. He remembered the vividness of his feelings at the time, however. It looked as if Peter and Polly were indeed going to arrive almost as if Ruburt had in fact called and invited them.

That evening the visit did take place. Actually, some work had prevented the couple from leaving when they intended. Instead, they called later from their home to say that they were just beginning their trip, and would stop on their way.

Ruburt was well prepared for the call by then, and for the visit ...”
