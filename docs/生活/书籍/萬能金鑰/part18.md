###### INTRODUCTION - PART EIGHTEEN

In order to grow we must obtain what is necessary for our growth. This is brought about through the law of attraction. This principle is the sole means by which the individual is differentiated from the Universal. 為求成長，我們必須獲取必要養分，這是源自吸引力法則──正是這條法則讓個人從宇宙中分化出來。

Think for a moment, what would a man be if he were not a husband, father, or brother, if he were not interested in the social, economical, political or religious world. He would be nothing but an abstract theoretical ego. He exists, therefore, only in his relation to the whole, in his relation to other men, in his relation to society. This relation constitutes his environment and in no other way. It is evident, therefore, that the individual is simply the differentiation of the one Universal Mind "which lighteth every man that cometh into the world," and his so-called individuality or personality consists of nothing but the manner in which he relates with the whole. 試想，如果一個男人既非丈夫、父親也非兄長，而且一貫漠視社會、經濟、政治或宗教世界，那麼，這個人就什麼都不是，只是一個抽象理論的自我。由此可知，個人只有在與整體、他人、社會建立關聯，才能算是存在。這種關聯是構成他周遭環境的唯一方法。因此，顯而易見的，個體就只是宇宙心智的分化，也就是「真光，照亮一切生在世上的人。」（譯註：出自《聖經》約翰福音1:9）人們所謂的個體化或人格化其實就只是個體與整體產生連結的方式。

This we call his environment and is brought about by the law of attraction. Part Eighteen, which follows, has something more to say concerning this important law. 吸引力法則造就了我們所謂的環境。接下來的課程將探討這個重要原理。

###### PART EIGHTEEN

1. There is a change in the thought of the world. This change is silently transpiring in our midst, and is more important than any which the world has undergone since the downfall of Paganism.  這個世界的思想觀念正在改變，這種變化在我們周遭悄然無聲地進行，這是自異教信仰衰亡以來，世界上最重要的變化。
2. These present revolution in the opinions of all classes of men, the highest and most cultured of men as well as those of the laboring class, stands unparalleled in the history of the world. 眼前這場革命代表不同階級族群的各種意見，從最高層級、文化素養最高的精英到底層的勞工階級，象徵著人類歷史上空前的變革。
3. Science has of late made such vast discoveries, has revealed such an infinity of resources, has unveiled such enormous possibilities and such unsuspected forces, that scientific men more and more hesitate to affirm certain theories as established and beyond doubt or to deny other theories as absurd or impossible. 最近，人類透過形形色色的科學發現，挖掘出無窮無盡的資源、並揭露了龐大的可能性與未知的力量，使得許多科學家越來越難以確定某些理論的正確性與肯定性，也越來越難對某些說法徹底否定，斷定那些是荒唐不經、絕無可能的謬論。
4. A new civilization is being born; customs, creeds, and precedent are passing; vision, faith and service are taking their place. The fetters of tradition are being melted off from humanity, and as the impurities of materialism are being consumed, thought is being liberated and truth is rising full robed before an astonished multitude. 新文明就此誕生。風俗、教條、陳規已成過去，改由願景、信念與服務取代。我們正逐步脫離傳統羈絆，由於唯物論的雜質已一一過濾淨化，思想一步步獲得解放，真理也因此得以在世人面前彰顯全貌。
5. The whole world is on the eve of a new consciousness, a new power, and a new realization within the self. 整個世界置身於迎接全新覺醒、力量與意識的前夕。
6. Physical Science has resolved matter into molecules, molecules into atoms, atoms into energy, and it has remained for Mr. J. A. Fleming, in an address before the Royal Institution, to resolve this energy into mind. He says, "In its ultimate essence, energy may be incomprehensible by us except as an exhibition of the direct operation of that which we call Mind or Will." 物理科學已經成功將物質分解為分子、將分子分解為原子，再將原子分解為量子；隨後，英國科學家J．A．傅萊明（J. A. Fleming）更在皇家科學院（Royal Institution）發表演說中提到將能量分解為心智的方法。他說：「就能量的終極本質而言，唯有當它直接表現出所謂『心智』或『意志』的運作形態時，我們方有可能理解。」
7. And this mind is the indwelling and ultimate. It is imminent in matter as in spirit. It is the sustaining, energizing, all pervading Spirit of the universe. 這裡所謂心智就是駐留在我們內心的終極能量，既存在於物質也存在於心靈。它就是維持一切永續發展、使生命充滿能量而且無處不在的宇宙能量。
8. Every living thing must be sustained by this omnipotent Intelligence, and we find the difference in individual lives to be largely measured by the degree of this intelligence, which they manifest. It is greater intelligence that places the animal in a higher scale of being than the plant, the man higher than the animal, and we find that this increased intelligence is again indicated by the power of the individual to control modes of action and thus to consciously adjust himself to his environment. 每一個生命個體都倚靠這全能的智慧才得以生存，而且我們也發現，人類個體之間的生命差異，泰半源於他們能夠多大程度地體現這種全能宇宙智慧而定。正是這門智慧使動物站在高出植物一個等級的位階，人類又比動物高出一個等級的位階。我們發現，透過個人控制行動模式的力量，可以增強智慧，進而自發自覺地自我調整以便適應周遭環境。
9. It is this adjustment that occupies the attention of the greatest minds, and this adjustment consists in nothing else than the recognition of an existing order in the universal mind, for it is well known that this mind will obey us precisely in proportion as we first obey it. 這個調適的過程占據最多心智的注意力，是認知宇宙心智的既有秩序。我們都知道，唯有先遵從宇宙心智之道，它才會聽命我們的吩咐。
10. It is the recognition of Natural Laws that has enabled us to annihilate time and space, to soar in the air and to make iron float, and the greater the degree of intelligence the greater will be our recognition of these Natural Laws and the greater will be the power we can possess. 我們若能充分認知自然法則就可以縮短時空距離、翱翔於天際，也能設法讓鋼筋鐵骨航行在水面上。我們發展的智慧越高，就越能理解這些自然法則，也就越能擁有更高深、強大的能力。
11. It is the recognition of the self as an individualization of this Universal Intelligence that enables the individual to control those forms of intelligence which have not yet reached this level of self- recognition; they do not know that this Universal Intelligence permeates all things ready to be called into action; they do not know that it is responsive to every demand, and they are therefore in bondage to the law of their own being. 能夠體認到自我是宇宙智慧個體化的人，就可以支配那些還沒達到自我認知層級的其他人──因為他們還不知道宇宙智慧無處不在，隨時準備好行動；也不知道宇宙智慧有能力回應一切需求，所以他們才會受制於自身物種須依循的規律。
12. Thought is creative and the principle on which the law is based is sound and legitimate and is inherent in the nature of things; but this creative power does not originate in the individual, but in the universal, which is the source and foundation of all energy and substance; the individual is simply the channel for the distribution of this energy. 思想具有創造力，此原則建立於合理可靠的基礎上，也根植於萬事萬物的內在本質。不過，這種創造力並非源自於人類個體，而是發自宇宙，它才是一切能量與物質的泉源，個體不過是這種能量分流的管道。
13. The individual is simply the means by which the universal produces the various combinations which result in the formation of phenomena, which depends upon the law of vibration, whereby various rates of rapidity of motion in the primary substance form new substances only in certain exact numerical ratios. 宇宙創造各式各樣的組合，因而產生形形色色的現象，這些組合的行程取決於共振法則的現象，個體只是依循它的指示行事。原始物質發生振動時，當其運行頻率符合某種精準的比例時，就會創造出新的物質。
14. Thought is the invisible link by which the individual comes into communication with the Universal, the finite with the Infinite, the seen with the Unseen. Thought is the magic by which the human is transformed into a being who thinks and knows and feels and acts. 思想是一種隱不可見的連結，使個體得以與宇宙溝通、讓有限得以與無限交流、讓有形得以與無形相應；它也是魔法，讓人類蛻變成得以思考、求知、感覺與行動的存在個體。
15. As the proper apparatus has enabled the eye to discover worlds without number millions of miles away, so, with the proper understanding, man has been enabled to communicate with the Universal Mind, the source of all power. 正如我們的雙眼只要藉由適合的器械，就可以探索幾百萬英里以外的世界，適當的理解力可以讓人們與所有力量的來源──宇宙心智溝通。
16. The Understanding which is usually developed is about as valuable as a VCR without a videotape; in fact, it is usually nothing more than a "belief", which means nothing at all. The savages of the Cannibal Islands believe something; but that proves nothing. 只有理解力不一定有價值，就跟錄放影機沒有錄影帶是同樣的道理。理解力只是一種「相信」，不具任何其他意義。這就好比小說《食人島》（*Cannibal Islands*）上的野人也有自己的信仰，但並不能證明任何真理。
17. The only belief which is of any value to anyone is a belief that has been put to a test and demonstrated to be a fact; it is then no longer a belief, but has become a living Faith or Truth. 對人類而言，唯一具有價值的，就是能夠被公開檢驗並證實為真的事實；在這個過程之後，相信再也不只是相信，而是活生生的信仰或真理。
18. And this Truth has been put to the test by hundreds of thousands of people and has been found to be the Truth exactly in proportion to the usefulness of the apparatus which they used.  這個真理已經接受過成千上萬人檢驗，人們發現，真理彰顯的程度與我們使用裝置的有效程度互成正比。
19. A man would not expect to locate stars hundreds of millions of miles away without a sufficiently strong telescope, and for this reason Science is continually engaged in building larger and more powerful telescopes and is continually rewarded by additional knowledge of the heavenly bodies. 我們若沒有精密的望遠鏡，就不用奢望可以親眼目睹數億英里以外的星球，為此，科學不斷演進，發展出更強大、更清晰的望遠鏡，讓我們持續瞭解天體知識，不斷獲取巨大回報。
20. So with understanding; men are continually making progress in the methods which they use to come into communication with the Universal Mind and its infinite possibilities. 人類理解力的領域也是如此，人們正一再地精進與宇宙心智、無限能力溝通的方法。
21. The Universal Mind manifests itself in the objective, through the principle of attraction that each atom has for every other atom, in infinite degrees of intensity. 宇宙心智藉由吸引力法則在客觀世界中彰顯，每一顆原子對其他原子也都會產生吸引力，並無限地擴充下去。
22. It is by this principle of combining and attracting that things are brought together. This principle is of universal application and is the sole means whereby the purpose of existence is carried into effect. 正是這結合、吸引萬事萬物的原則將一切連結成為一體。這原則通用於全宇宙，也是一切現有存在賴以成形的唯一途徑。
23. The expression of growth is met in a most beautiful manner through the instrumentality of this Universal Principle. 藉由這一宇宙原理的幫助，萬物成長都將達到最美麗壯觀的境界。
24. In order to grow we must obtain what is essential for our growth, but as we are at all times a complete thought entity, this completeness makes it possible for us to receive only as we give; growth is therefore conditioned on reciprocal action, and we find that on the mental plane like attracts like, that mental vibrations respond only to the extent of their vibratory harmony. 想要成長茁壯，就必須獲得能協助成長的必要元素。由於我們一直都是完美的思維實體，這種完美使我們只能接受我們所付出的。由此可見，成長建立在互惠的條件之上，我們會發現，同類事物會在精神層面上相互吸引，因為精神的共振只會回應那些能與它們保持和諧一致的共振。
25. It is clear, therefore, that thoughts of abundance will respond only to similar thoughts; the wealth of the individual is seen to be what he inherently is. Affluence within is found to be the secret of attraction for affluence without. The ability to produce is found to be the real source of wealth of the individual. It is for this reason that he who has his heart in his work is certain to meet with unbounded success. He will give and continually give; and the more he gives, the more he will receive. 所以，顯而易見，富足的思想只會回應那些志同道合的意念。人類的財富會與他的內在一致，也就是說，內在的富足正是吸引外在財富滾滾而來的祕密。我們發現，**創造生產的能力就是個人真正的財富資源，因此，如果一個人身、心、靈完全投入他著手進行的工作，那麼他的成功將永無止境。他會一而再、再而三地給予；但他付出越多，收穫也就越多。**
26. What do the great financiers of Wall Street, the captains of industry, the statesmen, the great corporation attorneys, the inventors, the physicians, the authors -- what do each of these contribute to the sum of human happiness but the power of their thought? 功成名就的華爾街金融大亨、產業領袖、政治家、企業律師、發明家、醫師與作家們，他們除了貢獻自己的思想力量，還能付出什麼以便促進人類福祉？
27. Thought is the energy which the law of attraction is brought into operation, which eventually manifests in abundance. **思想是一種借助吸引力法則運行的能量，最終體現在客觀世界的富裕充足。**
28. The Universal Mind is static Mind or Substance in equilibrium. It is differentiated into form by our power to think. Thought is the dynamic phase of mind. 宇宙心智是靜止狀態的心智，或者是處於平衡狀態的初始物質。我們的思考能力是宇宙心智的分化，而思想是心智的動態階段。
29. Power depends upon consciousness of power; unless we use it, we shall lose it, and unless we are conscious of it, we cannot use it. 力量取決於我們是否意識到它的存在；除非我們善用力量，否則我們就會失去它；除非我們意識到力量的存在，否則我們根本無法有效地善用它。
30. The use of this power depends upon attention; the degree of attention determines our capacity for the acquirement of knowledge which is another name for power. 我們善用力量的能力取決於注意力集中的程度，我們越專注，獲取知識的能耐就越強。知識就是力量。
31. Attention has been held to be the distinguishing mark of genius. The cultivation of attention depends upon practice. 專注向來是天才與眾不同的特質，專注的培養必靠練習。
32. The incentive of attention is interest; the greater the interest, the greater the attention; the greater the attention, the greater the interest, action and reaction; begin by paying attention; before long you will have aroused interest; this interest will attract more attention, and this attention will produce more interest, and so on. This practice will enable you to cultivate the power of attention. 興趣能夠誘發專注，個人感興趣的程度越高，注意力就越能集中；注意力越集中就代表興趣更加高昂；這就是所謂的相互作用。付出注意力之後，很快地你就會感到興致盎然；當你感興趣，就會願意付出更多注意力，繼而引發更強烈的興趣，一直延伸下去，這種練習可以讓你培養出專注力。
> 33. This week concentrate upon your power to create; seek insight, perception; try to find a logical basis for the faith which is in you. Let the thought dwell on the fact that the physical man lives and moves and has his being in the sustainer of all organic life air, that he must breathe to live. Then let the thought rest on the fact that the spiritual man also lives and moves and has his being in a similar but subtler energy upon which he must depend for life, and that as in the physical world no life assumes form until after a seed is sown, and no higher fruit than that of the parent stock can be produced; so in the spiritual world no effect can be produced until the seed is sown and the fruit will depend upon the nature of the seed, so that the results which you secure depend upon your perception of law in the mighty domain of causation, the highest evolution of human consciousness. 本週，請聚焦在自己的創造力，從探索自身具備的洞察力和感知能力做起；嘗試為心中的信念找到相對的邏輯基礎。仔細思考這個事實──人的肉身生存、行動在空氣之中，必須依賴維持有機生命的物質，因此我們必須呼吸空氣。接下來，請帶領思想沉浸在另一個事實──人的精神生存、行動，也同樣必須吸收一種更微妙的能量才得以存續。在真實自然界中，如果沒有播下種籽，就不會有新生命開花結果，產出的果實也絕對不會比母體的植物來得更優秀。精神世界中的運作之道也是同理，唯有播下種籽才能結出果實，而且果實本身的優劣取決於種籽本質的良窳。由此可知，你的一切境遇都取決於你領悟這種因果循環法則的程度，這一領域可說是人類意識的最高境界。

"There is no thought in my mind but it quickly tends to convert itself into a power and organizes a huge instrumentality of means." – Emerson

我的心中沒有所謂思想，就算有也會迅速轉化為能量，成為種種實現意圖的方式、手段。──愛默生
