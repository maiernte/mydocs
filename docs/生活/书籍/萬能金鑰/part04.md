##### INTRODUCTION

Enclosed herewith I hand you Part Four. This part will show you why what you think, or do, or feel, is an indication of what you are. 隨函附上第四週的課程，本週課程會揭露，為什麼你的想法、做法或感受會充分代表你是一個什麼樣的人。

Thought is energy and energy is power, and it is because all the religions, sciences and philosophies with which the world has heretofore been familiar have been based upon the manifestation of this energy instead of the energy itself, that the world has been limited to effects, while causes have been ignored or misunderstood. 思想即能量，能量即力量，而世人所熟悉的宗教、科學和哲學都奠基於能量的表現形式而非能量本身，因此全世界都僅見其後果，以至於起因完全遭到漠視或誤會曲解。

For this reason we have God and the Devil in religion, positive and negative in science, and good and bad in philosophy. 為此，我們在談論宗教時不免提到神與鬼、探討科學時會區分正極與負極，深究哲學時則會歸類善與惡。

The master key reverses the process; it is interested only in cause, and the letters received from students tell a marvelous story; they indicate conclusively that students are finding the cause whereby they may secure for themselves health, harmony, abundance, and whatever else may be necessary for their welfare and happiness. 《萬能金鑰》完全逆轉這個相對程序，它只專注於起因。我收到許多學員的來信，這些信不約而同顯示：當學員開始探索起因後，他們得以獲得健康、和諧、富有以及一切有助於幸福和快樂的條件。

Life is expressive and it is our business to express ourselves harmoniously and constructively. Sorrow, misery, unhappiness, disease and poverty are not necessities and we are constantly eliminating them. 生命是一種展現，而我們的本分就是展現出和諧及正面的自我。悲傷、痛苦、不幸、疾病和窮困都不是生活的必需品，我們要不斷地消滅它們。

But this process of eliminating consists in rising above and beyond limitation of any kind. He who has strengthened and purified his thought need not concern himself about microbes, and he who has come into an understanding of the law of abundance will go at once to the source of supply. It is thus that fate, fortune, and destiny will be controlled as readily as a captain controls his ship, or an engineer, his train. 消除這些不幸因素的過程在於提升自我並超越種種障礙限制。已經強化並淨化思想的個人無須擔心細菌的侵擾，而深諳富足法則的個人則會立即起身奔向供給的來源。所以，命運、好運與劫數都將盡在你的掌握中，正如船長指揮船艦，或是火車工程師駕駛火車一般。

##### PART FOUR

1. The "I" of you is not the physical body; that is simply an instrument which the "I" uses to carry out its purposes; the "I" cannot be the Mind, for the mind is simply another instrument which the "I" uses with which to think, reason, and plan. 你口中的「我」並非指生理的我，這具肉身只是「我」用以實現目標的工具；「我」也不可能意指心智，因為心智就只是「我」用以思考、推論並計劃的另一項工具。
2. The "I" must be something which controls and directs both the body and the mind; something which determines what they shall do and how they shall act. When you come into a realization of the true nature of this "I", you will enjoy a sense of power which you have never before known. 「我」指的是掌控、導引身、心、靈的東西；它決定身、心、靈應該做些什麼、又該如何做。當你領悟這個「我」的真實本質，就能享受前所未有的渾身充滿力量的感覺。
3. Your personality is made up of countless individual characteristics, peculiarities, habits, and traits of character; these are the result of your former method of thinking, but they have nothing to do with the real "I." 你的個性由無數的獨立特質、習慣和個性組成。這些都是你過往思考的產物，而不是真實的「我」。
4. When you say "I think" the "I" tells the mind what it shall think; when you say "I go" the "I" tells the physical body where it shall go; the real nature of this "I" is spiritual, and is the source of the real power which comes to men and women when they come into a realization of their true nature. 當你說「我覺得」的時候，「我」就是在告訴心智應當作如是想；當你說「我動身」，這個「我」就是在告訴這副軀體應當起而行；**「我」的真實本質屬於精神層面，它才是貨真價實的力量之源。**當人們領悟自己的本質後，這股力量就會與他們同在。
5. The greatest and most marvelous power which this "I" has been given is the power to think, but few people know how to think constructively, or correctly, consequently they achieve only indifferent results. Most people allow their thoughts to dwell on selfish purposes, the inevitable result of an infantile mind. When a mind becomes mature, it understands that the germ of defeat is in every selfish thought. 思考是「我」所獲得的最偉大、最神奇的力量，但僅有少數人知道如何進行正向積極的「正確思考」，因此幾乎所有人只能得到平庸的結果。多數人放任自己的思緒停頓在自私利己的目標上，這是幼稚心智無可避免的結果。當人類心智變得成熟才會進一步明白，**失敗的芽孢就潛伏在每一個自私的想法中**。
6. The trained mind knows that every transaction must benefit every person who is in any way connected with the transaction, and any attempt to profit by the weakness, ignorance or necessity of another will inevitably operate to his disadvantage. 受過訓練的心智自會明白，每一項交易都必須讓所有涉入的關係人獲得好處。如果有人企圖乘虛而入，利用他人的軟弱、無知或需求牟利，終將為自己招致損害。
7. This is because the individual is a part of the Universal. A part cannot antagonize any other part, but, on the contrary, the welfare of each part depends upon a recognition of the interest of the whole. 這是因為個人是宇宙的一部分。同一個整體的任意兩個部分不能互相抵觸；相反的，個人的福祉也都是建立在認同整體利益的基礎上。
8. Those who recognize this principle have a great advantage in the affairs of life. They do not wear themselves out. They can eliminate vagrant thoughts with facility. They can readily concentrate to the highest possible degree on any subject. They do not waste time or money upon objects which can be of no possible benefit to them. 真切體認這套法則的人能在生活中坐擁莫大的優勢，他們不會讓自己油盡燈枯，可以輕易地消除游移不定的想法；他們能輕鬆地發揮高度專注力在任何目標，而且不會浪費時間或金錢在無益的目標上。
9. If you cannot do these things it is because you have thus far not made the necessary effort. Now is the time to make the effort. The result will be exactly in proportion to the effort expended. One of the strongest affirmations which you can use for the purpose of strengthening the will and realizing your power to accomplish, is, "I can be what I will to be." 如果你無法做到這些，說明你至今都沒有付出必需的努力。現在，是付諸行動的時刻了。一分耕耘就會有一分收穫。你若想增強意志、認識自身力量以實現目標，最鏗鏘有力的說法就是：「**我可以成為我想成為的人。**」
10. Every time you repeat it realize who and what this "I" is; try to come into a thorough understanding of the true nature of the "I"; if you do, you will become invincible; that is, provided that your objects and purposes are constructive and are therefore in harmony with the creative principle of the Universe. 每當你重複「我可以成為我想成為的人」，應該清楚知道話中的「我」是誰、是什麼樣的人，試著徹底理解「我」的真正本質。如果你可以做得到，而你的目標和意圖正面且具建設性，還能與宇宙的創造法則和諧一致，那你就能所向披靡。
11. If you make use of this affirmation, use it continuously, night and morning, and as often during the day as you think of it, and continue to do so until it becomes a part of you; form the habit. 倘若你開始運用「我可以成為我想成為的人」這句話，請持之以恆地使用，想到就複誦一次，直到它成為你生活的一部分，成為一種習慣。
12. **Unless you do this, you had better not start at all, because modern psychology tells us that when we start something and do not complete it, or make a resolution and do not keep it, we are forming the habit of failure; absolute, ignominious failure.** If you do not intend to do a thing, do not start; if you do start, see it through even if the heavens fall; if you make up your mind to do something, do it; let nothing, no one, interfere; the "I" in you has determined, the thing is settled; the die is cast, there is no longer any argument. 除非你能堅持不懈，否則寧可不要開始。因為現代心理學警告我們，**每當我們轟轟烈烈地開始，卻虎頭蛇尾地結束，就等於是養成失敗的習慣**──**徹頭徹尾、極不光彩的失敗。**要是你無心貫徹始終，那根本就別開始；一旦你認真看待這件事，即使天塌下來也絕不能收手；倘若你下定決心付諸行動，那就幹到底，千萬別讓任何事、任何人插手干預。如果你心裡的「我」已經下定決心，那就要打死不退，毫無商量的餘地。
13. If you carry out this idea, beginning with small things which you know you can control and gradually increase the effort, but never under any circumstances allowing your "I" to be overruled, you will find that you can eventually control yourself, and many men and women have found to their sorrow that it is easier to control a kingdom that to control themselves. 要是你願意實踐這個想法，不妨就先從自己最有把握的小事做起，再慢慢加強力道；**無論遇到任何情況，絕對不要容許外人三言兩語就否決你的「我」。這樣你才會發現，自己最終得以掌握自我。**對很多人來說，管理一個國家比掌控自我簡單得多了。
14. But when you have learned to control yourself you will have found the "World Within" which controls the world without; you will have become irresistible; men and things will respond to your every wish without any apparent effort on your part. 一旦你學會掌控自己，就會發現一個駕馭外在世界的「內在世界」；你將立於不敗之地，外界的人、事、物都會如你所願，而你甚至不費吹灰之力。
15. This is not so strange or impossible as it may appear when you remember that the "World Within" is controlled by the "I" and that this "I" is a part or one with the Infinite "I" which is the Universal Energy or Spirit, usually called God. 上述情形並非異想天開或癡人說夢，只要你謹記──「內在世界」完全掌控在「我」手中，而且這個「我」正是無限之「我」的一部分──便能天從人願。所謂的無限之「我」即宇宙心智或能量，我們通常敬稱為上帝。
16. This is not a mere statement or theory made for the purpose of confirming or establishing an idea, but it is a fact which has been accepted by the best religious thought as well as the best scientific thought. 這些論點並不是為了證明或確立某一觀點而編出的說詞，而是最卓越的宗教與科學思想都已接受的事實。
17. Herbert Spender said: "Amid all the mysteries by which we are surrounded, nothing is more certain than that we are ever in the presence of an Infinite and Eternal Energy from which all things proceed." 英國社會學家赫伯特．史賓德（Herbert Spender）曾說：「在我們周遭的所有奇蹟中，最令人信服的一點就是，我們一直置身於無限、永恆的能量中，萬物由此而生。」
18. Lyman Abbott, in an address delivered before the Alumni of Bangor Theological Seminary, said: "We are coming to think of God as dwelling in man rather than as operating on men from without." 美國《展望週刊》（*The Outlook*）總編輯萊曼．艾伯特（Lyman Abbott）曾在斑戈神學院（Bangor Theological Seminary）的校友會發表演說時提到：「我們所想的上帝，居住在人們的心中，而不是在外部某處操控人類。」
19. Science goes a little way in its search and stops. Science finds the everpresent Eternal Energy, but Religion finds the Power behind this energy and locates it within man. But this is by no means a new discovery; the Bible says exactly the same thing, and the language is just as plain and convincing: "Know ye not that ye are the temple of the living God?" Here, then, is the secret of the wonderful creative power of the "World Within." 科學在這方面的探索只前進了一小步，隨後就停滯不前；科學發現了永恆能量，但宗教卻找出潛藏在這股能量背後的力量，並發現這力量來自人們的內在。但這個過程絕對不是新發現，《聖經》早已一字不差地告訴我們這件事，其用語直白、令人信服：「豈不知你們是神的殿、神的靈住在你們裡頭嗎？」（*譯註：《聖經》哥多林前書3：16*）這就是「內在世界」創造力的奧祕。
20. Here is the secret of power, of mastery. To overcome does not mean to go without things. Self-denial is not success. We cannot give unless we get; we cannot be helpful unless we are strong. The Infinite is not a bankrupt and we who are the representatives of Infinite power should not be bankrupts either, and if we wish to be of service to others we must have power and more power, but to get it we must give it; we must be of service. 這就是力量和權力的奧祕。克服險阻不代表必得赤手空拳；克己忘我也不等於就能取得成功。除非我們「擁有」，不然就無法「給予」，除非我們夠強壯，不然就無法助人。「無限宇宙」從不匱乏，我們身為無限力量的代言人，當然不應該是匱乏的；倘若我們希望終有一天能服務他人，就必須擁有力量，而且多多益善。但若想要擁有，首先我們要付出，對他人有所貢獻。
21. The more we give the more we shall get; we must become a channel whereby the Universal can express activity. The Universal is constantly seeking to express itself, to be of service, and it seeks the channel whereby it can find the greatest activity, where it can do the most good, where it can be of greatest service to mankind. 我們給得越多，也就得到越多。我們必須成為宇宙傳遞活力的管道。宇宙總是不斷地尋求自我釋放、尋求提供服務，它一直在尋找管道，好讓它可以做出最大貢獻，提供人類最充足的服務。
22. The Universal cannot express through you as long as you are busy with your plans, your own purposes; quiet the senses, seek inspiration, focus the mental activity on the within, dwell in the consciousness of your unity with Omnipotence. "Still water runs deep;" contemplate the multitudinous opportunities to which you have spiritual access by the Omnipresence of power. 如果你總是忙著自己的計畫或人生目標，宇宙就無法借你之手有所作為。你應該讓感官知覺平靜下來，尋求內心的志向，聚焦內在的精神活動，與無所不能的偉大力量合而為一。「寧靜以致遠」自有其道理，透過萬有能量賦予你的精神管道，密切關注各式各樣的機遇。
23. Visualize the events, circumstances and conditions which these spiritual connections may assist in manifesting. Realize the fact that the essence and soul of all things is spiritual and that the spiritual is the real, because it is the life of all there is; when the spirit is gone, the life is gone; it is dead; it has ceased to exist. 請試著在腦中一一描繪事件、場景和條件，精神層面的連結有助於發揮能量，使這些事物形象化。萬事萬物的精華皆在於它的精神，而且這股精神真實不虛，因為它就是生命的全部；一旦精神渙散，生命就跟著流逝；猶如槁木死灰，不復存在。
24. These mental activities pertain to the world within, to the world of cause; and conditions and circumstances which result are the effect. It is thus that you become a creator. This is important work, and the higher, loftier, grander and more noble ideals which you can conceive, the more important the work will become. 這些精神活動皆屬內在世界，屬於起因的世界；一切外在環境和境況都由內在世界孕育而生，這些也就是所謂的後果。因此，你才會成為創造者。這是一份重要的工作，當你構想的理念越是高尚、崇敬、宏偉與尊貴，這些工作也就益發重要。
25. Over-work or over-play or over-bodily activity of any kind produces conditions of mental apathy and stagnation which makes it impossible to do the more important work which results in a realization of conscious power. We should, therefore, seek the Silence frequently. Power comes through repose; it is in the Silence that we can be still, and when we are still, we can think, and thought is the secret of all attainment. 任何形態的過度勞動、縱情玩樂或是操勞身體的活動都會導致精神倦怠，使人停滯不前，無法進行這些更重要的、能使人瞭解顯意識真正力量的工作。因此，我們應當經常尋求「靜」，休息是為了走更長遠的路，在「平靜」中我們方得以「安定」；在「安定」當中，我們就有餘裕思考。思想才是獲得一切成就的祕密。
26. Thought is a mode of motion and is carried by the law of vibration the same as light or electricity. It is given vitality by the emotions through the law of love; it takes form and expression by the law of growth; it is a product of the spiritual “I”, hence its Divine, spiritual, and creative nature. 思想是一種運動形式，如同光跟電一樣，依循「共振法則」運行。它依循愛的法則，得到激情賦予它共振的活力；它依循成長法則自我塑形、自我表達；它是精神之「我」的產物，因此具有神聖、精神與創造性的自然本質。
27. From this it is evident that in order to express power, abundance or any other constructive purpose, the emotions must be called upon to give feeling to the thought so that it will take form. How may this purpose be accomplished? This is the vital point; how may we develop the faith, the courage, the feeling, which will result in accomplishment? 由此推論，**我們若想展現力量、財富或實現其他具有創造性的目標，必然得先召喚心中與那個想法相互呼應的激情，這樣它才能自我塑形。**但要怎麼做才能實現這個目的？我們又該如何發展引領我們達到成功的信念、勇氣與知覺？這一點至關重要。
28. The reply is, by exercise; mental strength is secured in exactly the same way that physical strength is secured, by exercise. We think something, perhaps with difficulty the first time; we think the same thing again, and it becomes easier this time; we think it again and again; it then becomes a mental habit. We continue to think the same thing; finally it becomes automatic; we can no longer help thinking this thing; we are now positive of what we think; there is no longer any doubt about it. We are sure; we know. 答案是：透過練習。**鍛鍊精神力量和鍛鍊身體力量的做法一模一樣，就是勤加練習。**我們思考某件事時，一開始起頭或許困難異常，但當我們再度思考同樣的事情，就會簡單許多；只要我們反覆推敲，最終思考就會變成一種習慣。我們持之以恆地思考同一件事，最終就會成為自然反應，變成自覺性的思考，對思考的內容轉趨積極正面，直到再也沒有絲毫的懷疑。我們非常確定，我們對這個法則了然於胸。
29. Last week I asked you to relax, to let go physically. This week, I am going to ask you to let go mentally. If you practiced the exercise given you last week fifteen or twenty minutes a day in accordance with the instructions, you can no doubt relax physically; and anyone who cannot consciously do this quickly and completely is not a master of himself. He has not obtained freedom; he is still a slave to conditions. But I shall assume that you have mastered the exercise and are ready to take the next step, which is mental freedom. 上星期我要求你讓身體自然放鬆，這星期則要求你學著放鬆心理。如果上星期你每天都依循指示練習我交辦的課程15～20分鐘，那你勢必掌握了放鬆之道。任何人若無法有意識迅速、完全地放鬆，表示他還無法為自己做主，因此也就得不到自由，仍舊是外在環境的奴僕。但我現在假定你已經十分熟悉這套練習，也已經準備好要邁入下一個階段，也就是前述的心靈自由。
30. This week, after taking your usual position, remove all tension by completely relaxing, then mentally let go of all adverse conditions, such as hatred, anger, worry, jealousy, envy, sorrow, trouble or disappointment of any kind. 本週，請維持你過去的姿勢，徹底地放鬆自己，卸下所有緊張，釋出心裡所有負面情緒，好比憎恨、憤怒、焦慮、嫉妒、羨慕、悲傷、煩惱、失望等。
31. You may say that you cannot "let go" of these things, but you can; you can do so by mentally determining to do so, by voluntary intention and persistence. 你可能會感覺自己似乎做不到徹底「放下」這一切，但只要你有決心、堅持不懈，就一定能夠做到。
32. The reason that some cannot do this is because they allow themselves to be controlled by the emotions instead of by their intellect. But those who will be guided by the intellect will gain the victory. You will not succeed the first time you try, but practice makes perfect, in this as in everything else, and you must succeed in dismissing, eliminating and completely destroying these negative and destructive thoughts; because they are the seed which is constantly germinating into discordant conditions of every conceivable kind and description. 有些人之所以無法做到，是因為他們放任自己被情感掌控而非由理智決定；願意受理智引導行事的人才能贏得勝利。你可能無法第一次嘗試就成功，但「熟能生巧」的道理在此也能適用。你必須先徹底排除心中一切消極的負面想法才能成功，因為負面思緒是不良種籽，會在心中持續滋生各種不協調的狀況。

> "There is nothing truer than that the quality of thought which we entertain correlates certain externals in the outside world. This is the Law from which there is no escape. And it is this Law, this correlative of the thought with its object, that from time immemorial has led the people to believe in special providence." - Wilmans
