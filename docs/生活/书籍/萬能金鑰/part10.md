###### INTRODUCTION - PART TEN

 If you get a thorough understanding or the thought contained in Part Ten, you will have learned that nothing happens without a definite cause. You will be enabled to formulate your plans in accordance with exact knowledge. You will know how to control any situation by bringing adequate causes into play. When you win, as you will, you will know exactly why. 如果你能融會貫通本週課程闡釋的觀念，你將學會「事出必有因」的道理，也就可以根據精準的知識制定計畫，並瞭解如何透過掌握「起因」，以便掌控一切狀況。當你如願以償地成為贏家，屆時就會清楚自己為何得勝。

The ordinary man, who has no definite knowledge of cause and effect, is governed by his feelings or emotions. He thinks chiefly to justify his action. If he fails as a businessman, he says that luck is against him. If he dislikes music, he says that music is an expensive luxury. If he is a poor office man, he says that he could succeed better at some outdoor work. If he lacks friends, he says his individuality is too fine to be appreciated. 一般人不瞭解事件因果的知識，因此往往會被自己的情緒或情感左右。他只會一味合理化自己的行為。倘若他經商失敗，就會推託時運不濟；要是不喜歡音樂，就說它是中看不中用的奢侈享受；如果他是個可憐兮兮的辦公室文書員，就會改口說自己更適合做外勤工作；假設他身邊沒朋友，就會自我安慰地說：「沒有人懂我。」

 He never thinks his problem through to the end. In short, he does not know that every effect is the result of a certain definite cause, but he seeks to console himself with explanations and excuses. He thinks only in self-defense. 他從來不曾徹底地檢討問題。一言以蔽之，他根本不明白，所有結果都起因於特定的原因，但他只會抬出一大堆解釋和藉口自我安慰。他的心中滿是自我防衛的想法。

 On the contrary, the man who understands that there is no effect without an adequate cause thinks impersonally. He gets down to bed rock facts regardless of consequences. He is free to follow the trail of truth wherever it may lead. He sees the issue clear to the end, and he meets the requirements fully and fairly, and the result is that the world gives him all that it has to give, in friendship, honor, love and approval. 反之，一個人如果體悟到「事出必有因」的道理，他就會理智客觀地思考。他會不計後果，就是要深入事情的真相；他會不論代價，就是要追隨真理而行；他對問題看得清楚透澈，並充分、恰當地善盡本分。最終結果是，這個世界將會無私地反饋他友情、愛情、榮譽與讚許。

###### PART TEN

1. Abundance is a natural law of the Universe. The evidence of this law is conclusive; we see it on every hand. Everywhere Nature is lavish, wasteful, extravagant. Nowhere is economy observed in any created thing. Profusion is manifested in everything. The millions and millions of trees and flowers and plants and animals and the vast scheme of reproduction where the process of creating and recreating is forever going on, all indicates the lavishness with which Nature has made provision for man. That there is an abundance for everyone is evident, but that many fail to participate in this abundance is also evident; they have not yet come into a realization of the Universality of all substance, and that mind is the active principle whereby we are related to the things we desire.  富裕充足是宇宙的自然法則，可以證明這條法則存在的證據近在咫尺，隨處可見。大自然的供給總是慷慨大方、甚至奢侈到浪費的程度；大自然的豐盈在萬事萬物身上表露無遺；成千上萬的樹林、花朵、植物、動物，以及那永續運行、不斷進行著創造與再生的龐大繁殖體系，在在都意味著，大自然為人類準備的豐沛供給。很明顯的，大自然將富饒全數提供人類使用，但許多人視而不見卻也是事實。他們尚未參透，宇宙就代表一切物質，也還沒領悟到「心智能使我們得到渴望事物」的重要原理。

2. All wealth is the offspring of power; possessions are of value only as they confer power. Events are significant only as they affect power; all things represent certain forms and degrees of power.  一切財富都是「力量」的產物，萬事萬物唯有獲予力量才有價值；事件唯有對力量發揮作用才意義重大；萬事萬物都在不同程度上代表不同形態的力量。

3. Knowledge of cause and effect as shown by the laws governing electricity, chemical affinity and gravitation, enables man to plan courageously and execute fearlessly. These laws are called Natural Laws, because they govern in the physical world, but all power is not physical power; there is also mental power, and there is moral and spiritual power. 人類一旦認知掌理電力、化學與地心引力等法則的因果論，就能勇敢無畏地制定、執行計畫，這些法則被稱為「自然法則」，因為有形世界便是按照這些法則運行，不過並非所有力量都是有形世界的力量，也有心靈層次的力量存在，這股力量更富道德寓意、更屬精神範疇。

4. Spiritual power is superior because it exists on a higher plane. It has enabled man to discover the law by which these wonderful forces of Nature could be harnessed and made to do the work of hundreds and thousands of men. It has enabled man to discover laws whereby time and space have been annihilated and the law of gravitation to be overcome. The operation of this law is dependent upon spiritual contact, as Henry Drummond well says:   心靈力量相對崇高，因為它立足更高的層次。它可以敦促人類去發現、並理解驅策大自然神奇力量的定律，並轉化成一股運行的動能，為成千上萬人服務；它也讓人類得以發現超越時空的定律，並找出克服地心引力定律的方法。這套法則的運作之道取決於精神聯繫，正如蘇格蘭的福音傳教士亨利．卓蒙德（Henry Drummond）恰如其分的比喻：

5. "In the physical world as we know it, there exists the organic and the inorganic. The inorganic of the mineral world is absolutely cut off from the plant or animal world; the passage is hermetically sealed. These barriers have never yet been crossed. No change of substance, no modification of environment, no chemistry, no electricity, no form of energy, no evolution of any kind can ever endow a single atom of the mineral world with the attribute of Life.” 「正如我們所知，有形世界區分為無機物和有機物；屬於無機物的礦物世界與屬於有機物的動、植物世界毫無交集，也就是互通有無的管道牢牢封死了，雙方之間的障礙不容跨越。物質不容改變、環境不容改造，也沒有化學、電力與其他任何形式的能量，更別提任何形態的演化，足以為礦物世界裡一顆小小原子賦予生命的烙印。

6. "Only by the bending down into this dead world of some living form can those dead atoms be gifted with the properties of vitality; without this contact with life they remain fixed in the inorganic sphere forever. Huxley says that the doctrine of Biogenesis (or life only from life) is victorious all along the line, and Tyndall is compelled to say: 'I affirm that no shred of trustworthy evidence exists to prove that life in our day has ever appeared independent of antecedent life.' 「唯有當某種生命形態屈身以就這片死寂的世界時，這些死氣沉沉的原子才獲得生命的屬性。礦物世界若不與生命聯繫，永遠只能停留在無機層次。博物學家湯瑪士．赫胥黎曾說，唯有生物才能創造生物的生源論（Biogenesis）放諸四海皆準；愛爾蘭物理學家約翰．丁達爾（John Tyndall）也不得不同意：『我承認，沒有一絲確鑿證據可以證明，我們今日所能見到的一切現存生命與更早之前的舊有生命毫不相關。』

7. "Physical laws may explain the inorganic, Biology explains and accounts for the development of the organic, but of the point of contact Science is silent. A similar passage exists between the Natural world and the Spiritual world; this passage is hermetically sealed on the natural side. The door is closed; no man can open it, no organic change, no mental energy, no moral effort, no progress of any kind can enable any human being to enter the spiritual world." 「物理定律或許可以解釋無機物，生物學可以闡述、詮釋有機體的進化發展，一旦論及生命和非生命之間聯繫的議題，科學便啞口無言。自然與靈性世界同樣也有一條相似的通道，在自然這一端已經被彌封，大門深鎖，誰也無法開啟；看不見有機體改變、精神能量、心靈力量，也絲毫沒有任何型態的進步，能夠驅使人類進入靈性世界的領域。」

8. But as the plant reaches down into the mineral world and touches it with the mystery of Life, so the Universal Mind reaches down into the human mind and endows it with new, strange, wonderful and even marvelous qualities. All men or women who have every accomplished anything in the world of industry, commerce or art have accomplished because of this process. 不過，正如植物帶著生命之祕深入礦物世界裡，宇宙心智也採用同一方式翩然降臨人間，賦予人類各種新的、奇異的、美好的，甚至是難以想像的特質。所有在工業、商業或是藝術領域中立下輝煌成就的人，都是體驗過這個歷程才得以實現成就。

9. Thought is the connecting link between the Infinite and the finite, between the Universal and the individual. We have seen that there is an impassable barrier between the organic and the inorganic, and that the only way that matter can unfold is to be impregnated with life; as a seed reaches down into the mineral world and begins to unfold and reach out, the dead matter begins to live, a thousand invisible fingers begin to weave a suitable environment for the new arrival, and as the law of growth begins to take effect, we see the process continue until the Lily finally appears, and even "Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these". 思想是牽繫「無限」與「有限」、「宇宙」與「個人」之間的連結，我們已經知道，在無機物和有機物之間存在一道無法跨越的鴻溝，唯有生命絲絲注入，物質才會步步開展。當種籽把細根深入礦物質世界中，不斷伸展、蔓延，周遭毫無生氣的物質才開始乍現生機，就像是數千隻看不見的手指開始為這名陌生來客編織合適的環境。成長法則也開始發揮作用，我們看到這道過程持續不輟，直到這朵「百合花」成熟綻放，就連「所羅門在最榮耀的時候，他所穿戴的，還不如這花一朵」。（譯註：《新約》馬太福音6：29）

10. Even so, a thought is dropped into the invisible substance of the Universal Mind, that substance from which all things are created, and as it takes root, the law of growth begins to take effect and we find that conditions and environment are but the objective form of our thought. 即使如此，當思想的種籽落在宇宙心智那一片孕育萬物的無形沃土中，然後開始生根發芽，成長法則就開始生效，於是我們也跟著發現，一切環境和境遇都只是我們的思想展現於客觀環境的一種形式。

11. The law is that Thought is an active vital form of dynamic energy which has the power to correlate with its object and bring it out of the invisible substance from which all things are created into the visible or objective world. This is the law by which, and through which all things come into manifestation; it is the Master Key by which you are admitted into the Secret Place of the Most High and are "given dominion over all things." With an understanding of this law you may "decree a thing and it shall be established unto thee." 思想是一種活躍的動態能量，具有與目標連結，並引領生命能量從無形狀態轉化為有形物質的力量。這套法則正是體現一切事物的根源，也就是讓你得以進入最高權力中心的聖殿並「治理萬物」的「萬能金鑰」。一旦你領悟這套法則，就能達到「定意要做何事，必然給你成就」（譯註：《聖經》約伯記22：28）境界。

12. It could not be otherwise; if the soul of the Universe as we know it is the Universal Spirit, then the Universe is simply the condition which the Universal Spirit has made for itself. We are simply individualized spirit and are creating the conditions for our growth in exactly the same way. 除此之外，沒有任何例外。倘若宇宙的靈魂一如我們所知，就是「宇宙精神」（Universal Spirit），那麼宇宙就單單是宇宙精神為自己創造的環境而已，我們也不過是被個體化的宇宙精神，正採用與祂相同的手法創造有助自身成長的生存環境。

13. This creative power depends upon our recognition of the potential power of spirit or mind and must not be confused with Evolution. Creation is the calling into existence of that which does not exist in the objective world. Evolution is simply the unfolding of potentialities involved in things which already exist. 這股創造性的力量端視我們對潛在的精神或心智力量有多少認知，請務必不要與「演化」混為一談。「創造」意指從無到有、無中生有，而「演化」就只是已存在的事物在展現其種種潛在的可能性而已。

14. In taking advantage of the wonderful possibilities opened up to us through the operation of this law, we must remember that we ourselves contribute nothing to its efficacy as the Great Teacher said: "It is not I that doeth the works, but the Father that dwelleth in me, He doeth the work". We must take exactly the same position; we can do nothing to assist in the manifestation, we simply comply with the law, and the All-originating Mind will bring about the result. 當我們善用這套法則實現眼前這些驚人的潛在可能性時，請務必記住，我們本身其實沒有貢獻，套用一句大師所言：「我若行了，你們縱然不信我，也當信這些事，叫你們又知道又明白：父在我裡面，我也在父裡面。」（譯註：《聖經》約翰福音 14：10）我們所能扮演的角色是一樣的，亦即我們對於「讓思想化為真實」這件事根本幫不上忙，我們只不過是遵從這道定律而行，孕育萬物那股精神力量就會帶來結果。

15. The great error of the present day is the idea that Man has to originate the intelligence whereby the Infinite can proceed to bring about a specific purpose or result. Nothing of this kind is necessary; the Universal Mind can be depended upon to find the ways and means for bringing about any necessary manifestation. We must, however, create the ideal, and this ideal should be perfect. 當代人類犯下的嚴重謬誤，就是認為自己必須具備足夠的智慧，無限的力量才能憑借這智慧達到某種特定的結果或目的。這種念頭毫無必要。我們可以倚賴宇宙心智找出實現一切所需的方法，但是在這個過程中，我們必須創造自己渴望的完美理想。

16. We know that the laws governing Electricity have been formulated in such a way that this invisible power can be controlled and used for our benefit and comfort in thousands of ways. We know that messages are carried around the world, that ponderous machinery does its bidding, that it now illuminates practically the whole world, but we know too that if we consciously or ignorantly violate its law by touching a live wire, when it is not properly insulated, the result will be unpleasant and possibly disastrous. A lack of understanding of the laws governing in the invisible world has the same result, and many are suffering the consequences all the time. 我們知道，掌管電力的法則是一股看不見的力量，它能以成千上萬種方式提供我們幸福和舒適的服務。我們知道，那笨重龐大的機器設備之所以能將訊息傳遞至全世界，都是因為電的緣故。但是我們也知道，不管是出於故意或無知去違反定律，去觸碰沒有絕緣處理的電線，其結果可是相當讓人不快甚至可能釀成巨災。同樣的道理，若不曾理解統治無形精神世界的法則，也可能產生類似的結果，有許多人因此而受苦。

17. It has been explained that the law of causation depends upon polarity, a circuit must be formed; this circuit cannot be formed unless we operate in harmony with the law. How shall we operate in harmony with the law unless we know what the law is? How shall we know what the Law is? By study, by observation. 有人會將因果關係法則解釋成極性原理，也就是說，兩者之間就像是有一條電路相通。除非我們與這套法則保持和諧圓滿的關係，否則這條線路無法接通。但除非我們理解法則本質，否則我們怎會知道應該如何保持和諧圓滿的關係？我們又該如何認識這套法則？答案是透過研究和觀察。

18. We see the law in operation everywhere; all nature testifies to the operation of the law by silently, constantly expressing itself in the law of growth. Where there is growth, there must be life; where there is life there must be harmony, so that everything that has life is constantly attracting to itself the conditions and the supply which is necessary for its most complete expression. 這套法則的證據隨處可見──整個自然體系無聲、持續地在生長法則中彰顯自己，以證明這套規律運行無阻。凡有成長之處，就會有生命；凡有生命之處，就會有和諧。因此，每一種有生命的物質都會持之以恆地為自己尋找供應充足、適合的環境，以便盡可能完整地展現自己。

19. If your thought is in harmony with the creative Principle of Nature, it is in tune with the Infinite Mind, and it will form the circuit, it will not return to you void; but it is possible for you to think thoughts that are not in tune with the Infinite, and when there is no polarity, the circuit is not formed. What, then, is the result? What is the result when a dynamo is generating electricity, the circuit is cut off and there is no outlet? The dynamo stops. **倘若你的思想能與自然的創造性原則保持和諧一致，那就能與無限心智同一頻率，並順勢形成一套電路，你的思想必當成就，不會無功而返。**但很有可能你思考的念頭與無限步調不一致，如此一來便無法形成一套電路。若此，結果將如何？要是一具發電機正在產出電力，但電路卻遭斷線無法輸電，那會怎樣？整具發電機只得停止運轉。

20. It will be exactly the same with you, if you entertain thoughts which are not in accordance with the Infinite and cannot therefore be polarized; there is no circuit, you are isolated, the thoughts cling to you, harass you, worry you, and finally bring about disease and possibly death; the physician may not diagnose the case exactly in this way, he may give it some fancy name which has been manufactured for the various ills which are the result of wrong thinking, but the cause is the same nevertheless. 同樣的道理完全可以套用在你身上。假設你懷抱的想法與無限不和諧一致，無法在宇宙和個人之間形成兩極，當然就不會有電流，於是你被絕緣斷線。你的這些想法會緊附你、駕馭你、煩擾你，最終還讓你疾病纏身，甚至可能致死。醫師可能無法如此精準地這樣診斷病症，他有可能只是從各種病名中挑一個來套在你的病症上，但這些病症其實起因都相同──都是「錯誤思想」的結果。

21. Constructive thought must necessarily be creative, but creative thought must be harmonious, and this eliminates all destructive or competitive thought. 建設性的思想必定也具備創造性，但具備創造性的思想還需要和諧這個要素，這麼一來，它就能消滅帶有破壞性或競爭性的思想。

22. Wisdom, strength, courage and all harmonious conditions are the result of power and we have seen that all power is from within; likewise, every lack, limitation or adverse circumstance is the result of weakness, and weakness is simply absence of power; it comes from nowhere, it is nothing -- the remedy then is simply to develop power, and this is accomplished in exactly the same manner that all power is developed, by exercise. 智慧、力量、勇氣和所有和諧圓融的條件都是力量發揮作用的結果，而我們也已經知道，所有力量都是由內而生。同樣的，匱乏、限制或不利的狀況都是軟弱所致，軟弱則是源於缺乏力量。軟弱來無影、去無蹤，無聲無形，唯一解方就是培養力量，而其實方法和開發所有其他能力的方法一樣，即勤加練習。

23. This exercise consists in making an application of your knowledge. Knowledge will not apply itself. You must make the application. Abundance will not come to you out of the sky, neither will it drop into your lap, but a conscious realization of the law of attraction and the intention to bring it into operation for a certain, definite and specific purpose, and the will to carry out this purpose will bring about the materialization of your desire by a natural law of transference. If you are in business, it will increase and develop along regular channels, possibly new or unusual channels of distribution will be opened and when the law becomes fully operative, you will find that the things you seek are seeking you. 所謂練習就是善用你的知識。知識不會自己發生作用，得由你來應用。財富不會從天而降，也不會自動送上門來，但是**你若能自發自覺認識吸引力法則，並設定明確、具體的目標意識，然後帶著堅定意志力採取行動付諸實現，大自然的吸引力法則就能促使你夢寐以求的願望真正落實。**假設你經商，這套法則將使你原有的通路更加發達，也為你打開全新的配銷通路；一旦這套法則運行無礙，你會發現自己在尋求的東西其實也正在尋找你。

> 24. This week select a blank space on the wall, or any other convenient spot, from where you usually sit, mentally draw a black horizontal line about six inches long, try to see the line as plainly as though it were painted on the wall; now mentally draw two vertical lines connecting with this horizontal line at either end; now draw another horizontal line connecting with the two vertical lines; now you have a square. Try to see the square perfectly; when you can do so draw a circle within the square; now place a point in the center of the circle; now draw the point toward you about 10 inches; now you have a cone on a square base; you will remember that your work was all in black; change it to white, to red, to yellow. 本週，請坐在你平常做練習的位置，然後挑選牆上一處空白或是任何方便的區塊，接著在心中冥想你正在牆壁上畫出一條大約十五公分的黑色橫線，請試著看清這條線，宛如它真的畫在牆上一樣。現在，想像你在橫線兩端畫出兩條垂直線，然後再畫一條橫線連接兩端。這樣你就得到一個正方形。試著讓自己清楚「看見」這個正方形，然後在正方形內部畫出一個圓。現在，請在圓心虛畫一個點，然後用意念將它移到眼前大約二十五公分處。現在，你得到一個墊在正方形上的圓錐體。你的圓錐體原本是墨黑色；試著把它變成白色，然後紅色，再來是黃色。

25. If you can do this, you are making excellent progress and will soon be enabled to concentrate on any problem you may have in mind. 如果你能一一辦到，那就表示你進步神速，很快就能夠做到聚焦思考各種問題了。
