###### INTRODUCTION - PART TWELVE

Part Twelve is enclosed herewith. In the fourth paragraph you will find the following statement: "You must first have the knowledge of your power; second, the courage to dare; third, the faith to do." 謹隨函附上第十二週課程。在第四段你會讀到這句聲明：「首先就是要瞭解自己的力量；其次就是要有挑戰的勇氣；第三便是要產生付諸行動的信心。」

If you concentrate upon the thoughts given, if you give them your entire attention, you will find a world of meaning in each sentence, and will attract to yourself other thoughts in harmony with them, and you will soon grasp the full significance of the vital knowledge upon which you are concentrating. 倘若你專注深入探究這些文字中要傳達的想法，全神貫注，你將會發現領悟每一句話中隱藏的深意，並開始吸引與它們和諧一致的想法，很快的，你就能掌握這些知識的真正意義。

Knowledge does not apply itself; we as individuals must make the application, and the application consists in fertilizing the thought with a living purpose. 知識無法應用自身，身而為人類的我們就必須將知識付諸應用；所謂應用就是要有一個明確的目標，以提供思想茁壯成長的養分。

The time and thought which most persons waste in aimless effort would accomplish wonders if properly directed with some special object in view. In order to do this, it is necessary to center your mental force upon a specific thought and hold it there, to the exclusion of all other thoughts. If you have ever looked through the viewfinder on a videocamera, you found that when the object was not in focus, the impression was indistinct and possibly blurred, but when the proper focus was obtained the picture was clear and distinct. This illustrates the power of concentration. Unless you can concentrate upon the object which you have in view, you will have but a hazy, indifferent, vague, indistinct and blurred outline of your ideal and the results will be in accordance with your mental picture. 許多人行動時漫無目標，因此浪費大量的時間與想法，要是他們能有個特定目標，然後把時間跟思想引導到這個願景的話，就可以創造出神奇的成果。你若想做到這一點，就必須集中自身的精神能量在某一特定想法，心無旁騖排除一切雜念。如果你曾經透過照相機的鏡頭看出去就會知道，倘若沒對準焦距，物體影像就會顯得模糊不清；若是調整好焦距，影像就會即刻變得清晰明朗。這個案例說明專注的力量之強大。除非你能專注於眼前的目標，否則就只看得到矇矓、差勁、模糊、不真切又髒污的輪廓。這樣的精神景象，也將影響你在有形世界中所能得到的結果。

###### PART TWELVE

1. There is no purpose in life that cannot be best accomplished through a scientific understanding of the creative power of thought. 只要能對思想的創造性力量進行有系統的理解，就能完美實現人生中的所有目標。
2. This power to think is common to all. Man is, because he thinks. Man's power to think is infinite, consequently his creative power is unlimited. 思考的力量人人皆有，人之所以為人，就是因為能夠思考。人類的思考力無窮限，因此創造力量也無遠弗屆。
3. We know that thought is building for us the thing we think of and actually bringing it nearer, yet we find it difficult to banish fear, anxiety or discouragement, all of which are powerful thought forces, and which continually send the things we desire further away, so that it is often one step forward and two steps backward. 儘管我們已經知道，思想會為我們打造出所思考的事物，拉近我們與目標之間的距離，然而另一方面我們還是會發現，驅逐恐懼、焦慮或沮喪等情緒有其困難，因為它們同樣具備強大的思想能量，不斷地把渴望的目標推離我們身邊，以至於我們經常前進一步、倒退兩步。
4. The only way to keep from going backward is to keep going forward. Eternal vigilance is the price of success. There are three steps, and each one is absolutely essential. You must first have the knowledge of your power; second, the courage to dare; third, the faith to do. 唯一可以阻止我們開倒車的方法就是持續向前邁進。**成功的代價就是要永遠保持清明警醒。當中包含三大必要步驟，每一步都至關重要：首先你必須瞭解自己的力量；其次就是要有挑戰的勇氣；第三便是要產生付諸行動的信心。**
5. With this as a basis you can construct an ideal business, an ideal home, ideal friends, and an ideal environment. You are not restricted as to material or cost. Thought is omnipotent and has the power to draw on the Infinite bank of primary substance for all that it requires. Infinite resources are therefore at your command . 以這三個步驟為基礎，你就能為自己打造理想的事業、家庭、朋友及環境。你不會受限於材料或成本的限制，因為思想本身無所不能，有能力為自己從宇宙的無限儲藏中提取所需要的一切材料。因此，無限資源全都在你的掌握中。
6. But your ideal must be sharp, clear-cut, definite; to have one ideal today, another tomorrow, and a third next week, means to scatter your forces and accomplish nothing; your result will be a meaningless and chaotic combination of wasted material. 不過，你的理想必須鮮明、清晰、確切。倘若你今天想著某個理想，明天又蹦出另一個理想，到了下星期再冒出第三個理想，這便意味著你只是在虛耗力量，結果一事無成；你所得到的成果就是毫無意義、混亂不堪的集合體。
7. Unfortunately this is the result which many are securing, and the cause is self evident. If a sculptor started out with a piece of marble and a chisel and changed his ideal every fifteen minutes, what result could he expect? And why should you expect any different result in molding the greatest and most plastic of all substances, the only real substance? 遺憾的是，許多人都走向這種後果，箇中原因自是不用多說。倘若一名雕塑家手中握有一塊大理石和一把鑿子，開始幹活以後卻每十五分鐘就改變一次心意，最終他會雕塑出什麼玩意兒？同理，你現在用來塑造的素材正是天地間可塑性最強、最偉大的唯一真實素材，如果你拿不定主意變來變去，結果和前述雕塑家又有何不同？
8. The result of this indecision and negative thought is often found in the loss of material wealth. Supposed independence which required many years of toil and effort suddenly disappears. It is often found then that money and property are not independence at all. On the contrary, the only independence is found to be a practical working knowledge of the creative power of thought. 這種優柔寡斷、消極負面的思想，多半會帶來物質財富損失的後果，導致自己花費多年辛勞和努力才建立的自主性轉瞬間化為烏有。這時你往往才看清楚，金錢和財富不足憑恃；反之，全世界唯一可以倚賴的能力就是實際運用思想的創造力。
9. This practical working method cannot come to you until you learn that the only real power which you can have is the power to adjust yourself to Divine and unchangeable principles. You cannot change the Infinite, but you can come into an understanding of Natural laws. The reward of this understanding is a conscious realization of your ability to adjust your thought faculties with the Universal Thought which is Omnipresent. Your ability to cooperate with this Omnipotence will indicate the degree of success with which you meet. 唯有當你理解，自身能夠擁有的唯一真實力量就是調整自己，使自己與神聖、不變的原則協調一致，這時才能掌握實際應用的方法。你無法改變無限，但可以敦促自己認清何謂自然法則，屆時你所得到的回報便是充分明白自己擁有一股能力，得以調整自己的念頭以便適應無所不在的宇宙思想。你將擁有與全能力量協調合作的能力，它將預示你未來有可能取得何等成就。
10. The power of thought has many counterfeits which are more or less fascinating, but the results are harmful instead of helpful. 有許多魚目混珠的贗品妄想取代思想的力量，它們或多或少能讓人心醉神迷，但後果卻往往是有害無益。
11. Of course, worry, fear, and all negative thoughts produce a crop after their kind; those who harbor thoughts of this kind must inevitably reap what they have sown. 當然，擔憂、焦慮與恐懼等負面想法也會產生各種形形色色的後果，緊抓住這些想法不放的人將會自食惡果。
12. Again, there are the Phenomena seekers who gormandize on the so-called proofs and demonstration obtained at materializing seances. They throw open their mental doors and soak themselves in the most poisonous currents which can be found in the psychic world. They do not seem to understand that it is the ability to become negative, receptive and passive, and thus drain themselves of all their vital force, which enables them to bring about these vibratory thought forms. 除此之外，還有一批喜好研究「靈異現象」的人會竭盡所能地尋求一些在降神會上獲得的所謂證據、神蹟等，他們完全敞開心靈大門，任由自己耽溺在具有強烈毒害作用的心靈世界能量流中，卻不明白其實這是一種讓他們變得消極、服從、被動的力量，還會因此讓自己深陷其中不可自拔，最終結果是精神耗盡，元神大傷。
13. There are also the Hindu worshippers, who see in the materializing phenomena which are performed by the so-called adepts, a source of power, forgetting, or never seeming to realize that as soon as the will is withdrawn the forms wither, and the vibratory forces of which they are composed vanish. 也有一批印度教崇拜者在所謂「大師」表演的顯靈現象中看到一股力量之源，但是他們若非完全忘記，就是從未體認，在那些現象中，一旦將意念抽離，它的形式也會隨之委靡，原本盈滿其中的能量也會在轉瞬間消逝。
14. Telepathy, or thought transference, has received considerable attention, but as it requires a negative mental state on the part of the receiver, the practice is harmful. A thought may be sent with the intention of hearing or seeing, but it will bring the penalty attached to the inversion of the principle involved. 更有不少人熱中「心電感應」，或說是「傳心術」，不過，對於心電感應的接受者來說，這種做法對精神帶來的影響有害無益。一個想法可能跟著意念傳達到對方的耳中或眼中，但它會帶給對方傷害，因為其中涉及的精神原則本末倒置。
15. In many instances, hypnotism is positively dangerous to the subject as well as the operator. No one familiar with the laws governing in the mental world would think of attempting to dominate the will of another, for by so doing, he will gradually (but surely) divest himself of his own power.  在多數情況下，催眠術對接受者與執行者來說同樣危險。任何深諳精神法則的人都不會想要控制他人的意志力，因為他要是這樣做的話，就會逐漸喪失自己所擁有的力量。
16. All of these perversions have their temporary satisfaction and for some a keen fascination, but there is an infinitely greater fascination in a true understanding of the world of power within, a power which increases with use; is permanent instead of fleeing; which not only is potent as a remedial agency to bring about the remedy for past error or results of wrong thinking, but is a prophylactic agency protecting us from all manner and form of danger, and finally is an actual creative force with which we can build new conditions and new environment. 上述思想力量的曲解都具備暫時性滿足的特點，甚至還可能提供一定的媚惑力，但是唯有真正領悟內在力量世界才能感受到更偉大的無限魅力，這股力量會隨著經常使用而持續成長。它將永恆存在，而非稍縱即逝；它不僅可以發揮補救功效，矯正以往錯誤思想的結果，也能帶來預防作用，保護我們免受各種形形色色危險的侵害；最後，它也是實際存在的創造性力量，我們借助這股力量便可為自己創造全新的環境和際遇。
17. The law is that thought will correlate with its object and bring forth in the material world the correspondence of the thing thought or produced in the mental world. We then discern the absolute necessity of seeing that every thought has the inherent germ of truth in order that the law of growth will bring into manifestation good, for good alone can confer any permanent power. 這個法則的內容是，人的思想會與其目標彼此吸引連結，因此在精神世界中思考或產出的念頭，便會在物質世界中一一對應實現。這時我們會從中領悟到：人必須知道他的每個思想中都埋藏著真理的種子。唯有透過這樣的認知，成長法則才能將這些種子化為各種真善美，因為真善美本身就具足一切永恆的力量。
18. The principle which gives the thought the dynamic power to correlate with its object, and therefore to master every adverse human experience, is the law of attraction, which is another name for love. This is an eternal and fundamental principle, inherent in all things, in every system of Philosophy, in every Religion, and in every Science. There is no getting away from the law of love. It is feeling that imparts vitality to thought. Feeling is desire, and desire is love. Thought impregnated with love becomes invincible. 這條賦予思想動態的能量，好讓它與目標相連，並因此掌控一切不利人類經驗的法則即「吸引力法則」，它是永恆的基本法則，內蘊於萬物之中、存在於一切哲學體系、一切宗教、一切科學中。萬事不離這條愛的法則。它是賦予思想活力的情感，而情感就是渴望、渴望就是愛。在愛中孕育而生的思想將會所向無敵、百戰百勝。
19. We find this truth emphasized wherever the power of thought is understood, The Universal Mind is not only Intelligence, but it is substance, and this substance is the attractive force which brings electrons together by the law of attraction so that they form atoms; the atoms in turn are brought together by the same law and form molecules; molecules take objective forms; and so we find that the law of love is the creative force behind every manifestation, not only of atoms, but of worlds, of the Universe, of everything of which the imagination can form any conception. 我們發現，無論在何處，只要瞭解思想的力量，真理就得以強化。宇宙心智不僅是智慧，也是構成萬物的基本元素，這種元素會依循吸引力的定律，透過吸引力聚集電子形成原子，而原子也會依循同樣法則聚在一起形成分子，最終分子也一樣比照辦理形成外在世界的有形實體。由此我們發現，愛的法則是每一種現象背後那一股創造性力量，不僅創造一顆顆原子，也創造出整個世界、整個宇宙，以及想像力所能賦予形態和觀念的萬事萬物。
20. It is the operation of this marvelous law of attraction which has caused men in all ages and all times to believe that there must be some personal being who responded to their petitions and desires, and manipulated events in order to comply with their requirements. 正是因為這條神奇的吸引力法則運行如常，使得世世代代的人類始終相信，冥冥中似乎有什麼人格化的存在，可以回應人們的祈求和心願，並掌控大大小小事件，以便應允人們的需求。
21. It is the combination of Thought and Love which forms the irresistible force, called the law of attraction. All natural laws are irresistible, the law of Gravitation, or Electricity, or any other law operates with mathematical exactitude. There is no variation, it is only the channel of distribution which may be imperfect. If a bridge falls, we do not attribute the collapse to any variation of the law of gravitation. If a light fails us, we do not conclude that the laws governing electricity cannot be depended upon, and if the law of attraction seems to be imperfectly demonstrated by an inexperienced or uninformed person, we are not to conclude that the greatest and most infallible law upon which the entire system of creation depends has been suspended. We should rather conclude that a little more understanding of the law is required, for the same reason that a correct solution of a difficult problem in Mathematics is not always readily and easily obtained. **思想一旦與愛結合就會形成沛然莫之能禦的力量，這股力量就是吸引力法則。**所有自然界的法則都不可抗拒，無論是重力法則、電力法則或其他法則，都具有一如數學般的精確度。自然界的法則從未改變，只不過傳布力量的管道可能不夠盡善盡美。好比倘若一座橋崩塌了，我們不能把它歸咎於重力法則發生改變；若是燈泡不亮，我們也不能擅自歸納出電力法則不再可信的結論。同理，如果吸引力法則在沒有經驗或一無所知的人身上無法發揮作用，我們也不能就此質疑這條最偉大、最正確，且整個創造體系都賴以為生的法則。反之，我們應該明瞭，自己理解這道法則的程度尚猶不足，就好比我們計算一道數學難題時，並非總是可以迅速、輕易就得出正確答案。兩者道理相通。
22. Things are created in the mental or spiritual world be fore they appear in the outward act or event. by the simple process of governing our thought forces today, we help create the events which will come into our lives in the future, perhaps even tomorrow. Educated desire is the most potent means of bringing into action the law of attraction. 所有事物都是先在精神或心靈世界中創造而成，繼之才會透過行為或事件展現在外在世界。今日，我們透過一些簡單過程來控制思想的力量，就是在協助創造即將發生在明天或未來生活中的事件。我們若想在行動中落實吸引力法則，最有效的方法就是產生有憑有據的渴望。
23. Man is so constituted that he must first create the tools, or implements by which he gains the power to think. The mind cannot comprehend an entirely new idea until a corresponding vibratory brain cell has been prepared to receive it. This explains why it is so difficult for us to receive or appreciate an entirely new idea; we have no brain cell capable of receiving it; we are therefore incredulous; we do not believe it. 人類有一個特點：必須先創造出工具或器械，然後才能善用這項工具獲得思考能力。倘使我們的大腦中沒有可以和全新的理念發生共振的腦細胞，思想肯定就不會接受這道理念。這就是為什麼我們總是很難接受或認可一個全新理念的真正原因。正是因為我們的大腦缺乏可以接收的細胞，因此才會產生懷疑，我們才會不相信它。
24. If, therefore, you have not been familiar with the Omnipotence of the law of attraction, and the scientific method by which it can be put into operation, or if you have not been familiar with the unlimited possibilities which it opens to those who are enabled to take advantage of the resources it offers, begin now and create the necessary brain cells which will enable you to comprehend the unlimited powers which may be yours by cooperating with Natural Law. This is done by concentration or attention. 由此可知，要是你至今尚不瞭解吸引力法則的全能力量，也不明白它運作的科學方法，又或者你根本不知道無限可能性的大門全然洞開，任由所有能夠善用資源的人予取予求，那麼不妨就從現在開始，自發性創造出必要的腦細胞，讓自己也能親炙這股無限力量。只要你能與自然法則協調一致，這一股力量就會屬於你。你只需專心致志或聚精會神就能辦到。
25. The intention governs the attention. Power comes through repose. It is by concentration that deep thoughts, wise speech, and all forces of high potentiality are accomplished. 人的意念決定其注意力之所在，心靈靜止於一處才能產生力量。你只要集中意念，所有深入思想、睿智談吐和各種高度潛能都會發揮得淋漓盡致。
26. It is in the Silence that you get into touch with the Omnipotent power of the subconscious mind from which all power is evolved. 你會在一片寂靜中與潛意識那無所不能的力量建立聯繫，一切力量都是源於「靜」的狀態。
27. He who desires wisdom, power, or permanent success of any kind will find it only within; it is an unfoldment. The unthinking may conclude that the silence is very simple and easily attained, but it should be remembered that only in absolute silence may one come into contact with Divinity itself; may learn of the unchangeable law and open for himself the channels by which persistent practice and concentration lead to perfection. 任何渴求智慧、力量或永恆成就的人都可以在內心世界找到答案。缺乏思考能力的人可能會以為，寂靜的境界輕而易舉就能實現，但請務必記住，唯有在絕對寂靜的狀態下才能夠觸及神聖本身，也才能領悟永恆不變的法則。你若能聚精會神、堅持不懈練習，就能為自己打開通往完美的大門。

> 28. This week go to the same room, take the same chair, the same position as previously; be sure to relax, let go, both mentally and physically; always do this; never try to do any mental work under pressure; see that there are no tense muscles or nerves, that you are entirely comfortable. Now realize your unity with omnipotence; get into touch with this power, come into a deep and vital understanding, appreciation, and realization of the fact that your ability to think is your ability to act upon the Universal Mind, and bring it into manifestation, realize that it will meet any and every requirement; that you have exactly the same potential ability which any individual ever did have or ever will have, because each is but an expression or manifestation of the One, all are parts of the whole, there is no difference in kind or quality, the only difference being one of degree. "Thought cannot conceive of anything that may not be brought to expression. He who first uttered it may be only the suggester, but the doer will appear." - Wilson. 本週，請前往同一空間，端坐在同一張椅子上，並保持一貫同樣的姿勢。請務必放鬆，讓心靈和肉體都保持自然的狀態。每次練習都要放鬆，千萬不要試圖在壓力下展開任何精神之旅，切記要讓神經和肌肉保持放鬆狀態，讓自己感覺舒適。現在，請意識到自己與全能的力量和諧一致，然後與這股力量建立聯繫，並深刻領悟、理解、感知這個事實──你的思考力就是你作用於宇宙心智並使它化為實體的能力；請體認到它有能力滿足你所有的要求；請明白你與任何人已經擁有或可能擁有的潛力完全一模一樣，因為任何個體都只不過是宇宙整體的彰顯或體現，全都是整體的組成部分，在型態和特質上並無不同，唯一差異僅僅是程度有別而已。「思想無法構思不能被表現的事物。怀有渴望的人只是事情的啟動者，而必有行動者緊隨其後。」—— 威尔逊
