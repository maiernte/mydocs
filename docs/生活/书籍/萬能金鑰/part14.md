###### INTRODUCTION

You have found from your study thus far that thought is a spiritual activity and is therefore endowed with creative power. This does not mean that some thought is creative, but that all thought is creative. This same principle can be brought into operation in a negative way, through the process of denial. 打從你開始研究以來，至今已經學到，思想是一種靈性活動，因此被賦予創造力。但這不意味著僅有某些思想才具備創造力，而是所有思想皆然。而同樣的原則也可以經由「拒絕去想」，讓這個原理反向運作。

The conscious and subconscious are but two phases of action in connection with one mind. The relation of the subconscious to the conscious is quite analogous to that existing between a weather vane and the atmosphere. Just as the least pressure of the atmosphere causes an action on the part of the weather vane, so does the least thought entertained by the conscious mind produce within your subconscious mind action in exact proportion to the depth of feeling characterizing the thought and the intensity with which the thought is indulged. 當心理決定行動時，會經歷顯意識和潛意識兩大階段，兩者的關係與風向計和大氣的關係有異曲同工之妙。大氣稍有動靜，風向計也會產生相應行動，即使是最微不足道的想法，顯意識也會造成內在潛意識的行動，且影響的程度會隨著感覺的深切程度和意念的投入程度互成正比。

It follows that if you deny unsatisfactory conditions, you are withdrawing the creative power of your thought from these conditions. You are cutting them away at the root. You are sapping their vitality. 所以，假若你拒絕去想種種令你不滿的情境，就等於是將思想的創造力抽離出這些情境，你正在對它們趕盡殺絕、扼殺它們的活力。

Remember that the law of growth necessarily governs every manifestation in the objective, so that a denial of unsatisfactory conditions will not bring about instant change. A plant will remain visible for some time after its roots have been cut, but it will gradually fade away and eventually disappear, so the withdrawal of your thought from the contemplation of unsatisfactory conditions will gradually, but surely, terminate these conditions. 請謹記，生長法則掌控著客觀世界的一切事物，所以拒絕去想令自己不滿意的情境並不會帶來立即見效的轉機。一株植物若被連根拔起，儘管短時間內仍然會保持青翠本色，但不消幾日就會日漸枯萎、終至失去生氣。所以，你若把思想從不滿意的情境中抽離，這樣的狀態也會終止。

You will see that this is an exactly opposite course from the one which we would naturally be inclined to adopt. It will therefore have an exactly opposite effect to the one usually secured. Most persons concentrate intently upon unsatisfactory conditions, thereby giving the condition that measure of energy and vitality which is necessary in order to supply a vigorous growth. 你將看到，這是一個與我們習慣的方式截然相反的過程。因此，它導致的結果也將是天壤之別。多數人只會把注意力集中在令他們不滿的情境中，所以這種聚精會神的負面思考就會灌注負面情境充分的能量和活力，讓它們迅速成長茁壯。

###### PART FOURTEEN

1. The Universal Energy in which all motion, light, heat, and color have their origin, does not partake of the limitation of the many effects of which it is the cause, but it is supreme over them all. This Universal Substance is the source of all Power, Wisdom and Intelligence. 宇宙能量無極限，既是所有運動、光、熱、色彩的源頭，也是一切後果的起因，但是它又凌駕一切。宇宙物質是一切力量、智慧和才智之源。
2. To recognize this Intelligence is to acquaint yourself with the knowing quality of Mind and through it to move upon the Universal Substance, and bring it into harmonious relations in your affairs. 你若想認識這種智慧，就得認清這種心智的特質，進而熟悉宇宙的實質，終而讓它與自己周遭的事務保持和諧關係。
3. This is something that the most learned physical science teacher has not attempted -- a field of discovery upon which he has not yet launched; in fact, but few of the materialistic schools have ever caught the first ray of this light. It does not seem to have dawned upon them that wisdom is just as much present everywhere as are force and substance. 即便是最博學多聞的物理科學大師都未曾嘗試過──這是一個他自己從未領略過的領域；事實上，幾乎所有唯物主義學派都未曾涉足此地，他們從未領受這智慧之光。他們並未意識到，智慧就像能量、物質，其實無所不在。
4. Some will say, if these principles are true, why are we not demonstrating them? As the fundamental principle is obviously correct, why do we not get proper results? We do. We get results in exact accordance with our understanding of the law and our ability to make the proper application. We secured no results from the laws governing electricity until someone formulated the law and showed us how to apply it. 有些人會說，要是這些原則都是真理，為何我們無法證明？如果這個基本原則顯然正確無誤，為何我們就是無法獲得美好結果？事實上，我們可以。我們所能獲得的結果，正與我們體悟基本原則的程度、運用基本原則的能力互成正比。如同要有某個人先總結出電性法則，並廣為傳授應用方法，我們才知道如何善用電力產出成果。
5. This puts us in an entirely new relation to our environment, opening up possibilities previously undreamed of, and this by an orderly sequence of law which is naturally involved in our new mental attitude. 這一進步讓我們與外在環境建立起一段全新的關係，它為我們打開以前從未夢想過的機遇之窗，這是因為我們的心靈狀態更新後，會自然啟動一系列有序的法則建立。
6. Mind is creative and the principle upon which this law is based is sound and legitimate and is inherent in the nature of things; but this creative power does not originate in the individual, but in the Universal, which is the source and fountain of all energy and substance, the individual is simply the channel for the distribution of this energy. The individual is the means by which the Universal produces the various combinations which result in the formation of phenomena. 心智具有創造力，內蘊於萬物的本質中，其原則的基礎堅固不移、合情合理。不過，這種創造性能量並非源自人，而是源自宇宙，它才是一切能量、物質的初始與泉源，每人只不過是這能量的分流管道，宇宙透過人創造各種形形色色的組合，因此催生出各種現象。
7. We know that scientists have resolved matter into an immense number of molecules; these molecules have been resolved into atoms, and the atoms into electrons. The discovery of electrons in high vacuum glass tubes containing fused terminals of hard metal, indicates conclusively that these electrons fill all space; that they exist everywhere, that they are omnipresent. They fill all material bodies and occupy the whole of what we call empty space. This, then, is the Universal Substance from which all things proceed. 我們知道，科學家已經研究出把物質解構成無限的分子，再將分子分解為原子，最後將原子分解為電子的技術。觀察電子在內含硬金屬融斷器的高真空玻璃管中活動，你會發現電子充滿整支玻璃管；它們存在於萬物之中、無所不在；它們盈滿一切物質，填充我們曾經以為是真空地帶的區域。由此可知，這就是孕育萬事萬物的宇宙物質。
8. Electrons would forever remain electrons unless directed where to go to be assembled into atoms and molecules, and this director is Mind. A number of electrons revolving around a center of force constitutes an atom; atoms unite in absolutely regular mathematical ratios and form molecules, and these unite with each other to form a multitude of compounds which unite to build the Universe. 電子如果沒有接受指令組成原子或分子的話，就永遠只是電子型態，而電子的指揮者就是心智。當大量電子圍繞一個能量的核心旋轉就會組成原子；當原子按照一定的數學比例結合就會形成分子。分子與分子會相互聯合，形成了各式各樣的化合物；這些化合物最終構成了整個宇宙。
9. The lightest known atom is hydrogen and this is 1,700 times heavier than an electron. An atom of mercury is 300,000 times heavier than an electron. Electrons are pure negative electricity, and as they have the same potential velocity as all other cosmic energy, such as heat, light, electricity and thought (189,380 miles per second), neither time nor space require consideration. The manner in which the velocity of light was ascertained is interesting. 目前我們已知的最小原子是氫原子，它的重量約莫是電子的一千七百倍；一顆汞原子的重量是電子的三十萬倍。電子是純粹的負電荷，由於它和熱、光、電能、思想等其他所有的宇宙能量都具備同樣的勢流速度（Potential Velocity），更不必考慮到時間和空間。證明光速的存在方式是很有意思的。
10. The velocity of light was obtained by the Danish astronomer Roemer in 1676, by observing the eclipses of Jupiter's moons. When the earth was nearest to Jupiter, the eclipse appeared about eight and one-half minutes too soon for the calculations, and when the earth was most remote from Jupiter, they were about eight and one-half minutes too late. Roemer concluded the reason to be that it required 17 minutes for light from the planet to traverse the diameter of the earth's orbit, which measured the difference of the distances of the earth from Jupiter. This calculation has since been verified, and proves that light travels about 186,000 miles a second.  光速是由丹麥天文學家歐列．羅美爾（Ole Romer）在一六七六年觀察木星的月食現象期間量測的結果。他計算出，當地球最接近木星時，木星發生月食的時間會比預期提早八分半鐘，但是當地球運行到距離木星最遠的位置上時，木星發生月食的時間比預期延遲八分半鐘。羅美爾因而歸納箇中原因並得出結論，從木星直射而來的光線需要十七分鐘穿越地球軌道半徑，因而造成地球與木星距離的差異。他的推論經過檢驗後得到證實，光的行進速度是每秒十八萬六千英里。
11. Electrons manifest in the body as cells, and possess mind and intelligence sufficient for them to perform their functions in the human physical anatomy. Every part of the body is composed of cells, some of which operate independently; others in communities. Some are busy building tissue, while others are engaged in forming the various secretions necessary for the body. Some act as carriers of material; others are the surgeons whose work it is to repair damage; others are scavengers, carrying off waste; others are constantly ready to repel invaders or other undesirable intruders of the germ family. 電子在人體內的作用和細胞如出一轍，同時具備足以讓它們在人體內完美運行各種功能的精神和智慧。身體的每一個部位都由細胞構成，有些會單獨行動，另一些則會成群結隊；有些忙著建設人體組織，有些則是從事建設人體所需各種分泌物的活動；有些是物質搬運工，也有一些就像是修復創傷的外科醫生；有些是清道夫，負責清掃搬運垃圾；更有一些負責防禦工作，阻擋病菌家族攻城掠地。
12. All these cells are moving for a common purpose and each one is not only a living organism, but has sufficient intelligence to enable it to perform its necessary duties. It is also endowed with sufficient intelligence to conserve the energies and perpetuate its own life. It must, therefore, secure sufficient nourishment and it has been found that it exercises choice in the selection of such nourishment. 所有細胞運動都有一個共同目的，每一顆細胞不只是有生命的有機體，還具備了飽滿的智慧，讓它可以擔負起必要的職責；同時它還被賦予足以讓它保存能量、延續自身生命的智慧，因此，它必須獲得充足養分，而且我們也發現，它們會精挑細選自身所需的養分。
13. Each cell is born, reproduces itself, dies and is absorbed. The maintenance of health and life itself depends upon the constant regeneration of these cells. 每一顆細胞都得經歷誕生、繁殖、死亡和被分解吸收的過程，我們能否維持生命與健康，完全取決於這些細胞的新陳代謝。
14. It is therefore apparent that there is mind in every atom of the body; this mind is negative mind, and the power of the individual to think makes him positive, so that he can control this negative mind. This is the scientific explanation for metaphysical healing, and will enable anyone to understand the principle upon which this remarkable phenomenon rests. 因此，顯然體內的每一顆原子中都具備了心智的力量，這裡所謂心智包含了負面心智，但我們的思考能量可以讓自己產生正面力量，所以人們可以控制負面心智。這就是超自然療法的科學解釋，足以讓人人理解這種奇妙現象所憑恃的真理。
15. This negative mind, which is contained in every cell of the body, has been called the subconscious mind, because it acts without our conscious knowledge. We have found that this subconscious mind is responsive to the will of the conscious mind. 這種負面心智蘊藏在體內每一顆細胞裡，一向被稱為潛意識心智，因為它的行動不須顯意識的知識即可運作。所幸我們已經知道，潛意識心智會回應我們的顯意識。
16. All things have their origin in mind, and appearances are the result of thought. So that we see that things in themselves have no origin, permanency, or reality. Since they are produced by thought, they can be erased by thought. 萬事萬物都源於心智，外觀表象僅是內在思想的產物。由此可知，萬事萬物的起源都不在自身，既無法持久，也虛幻不實。那麼，既然它們都是思想的產物，也就可以透過思想來摒除。
17. In mental, as in natural science, experiments are being made and each discovery lifts man one step higher toward his possible goal. We find that every man is the reflection of the thought he has entertained during his lifetime. This is stamped on his face, his form, his character, his environment.  在自然科學領域有許多實驗在進行著，同樣的，心靈領域也有很多實驗在進行，每一次的新發現都會驅使我們朝著可能的目標前進一大步。我們發現，每個人的現狀都是他所抱持的種種思想的反映，因此他的思想塑造了他的外貌、形體、性格與際遇。
18. Back of every effect there is a cause, and if we follow the trail to its starting point, we shall find the creative principle out of which it grew. Proofs of this are now so complete that this truth is generally accepted. 回溯事出必有因的道理，倘若我們追本溯源找到發源地，就會發現它起始的創造原理。有關這一點，當今的證據非常完整充分，因此這項真理早已廣為周知。
19. The objective world is controlled by an unseen and, heretofore, unexplainable power. We have, heretofore, personalized this power and called it God. We have now, however, learned to look upon it as the permeating essence or Principle of all that exists -- the Infinite or Universal Mind. 客觀世界掌控在一種隱不可見，至今仍無法解釋的能量中。我們一貫人格化這種能量，稱之為上帝。不過，現在我們已經學會應將它視為普遍深入萬物的精神本質或原理，也就是無限或宇宙心智。
20. The Universal Mind, being infinite and omnipotent, has unlimited resources at its command, and when we remember that it is also omnipresent, we cannot escape the conclusion that we must be an expression or manifestation of that Mind. 無限、無所不能的宇宙心智擁有無邊無際的資源，它同時也無所不在，因此我們不能迴避這一結論：我們自身一定是宇宙心智的表達或彰顯。
21. A recognition and understanding of the resources of the subconscious mind will indicate that the only difference between the subconscious and the Universal is one of degree. They differ only as a drop of water differs from the ocean. They are the same in kind and quality, the difference is one of degree only. 如果我們對潛意識精神所具備的資源有所認識與理解，就會知道，潛意識和宇宙之間的唯一差異就在於程度有別。兩者之間的差異就有如一滴水珠對比一片海洋。兩者型態與本質一模一樣，唯一差異就在於程度有別。
22. Do you, can you, appreciate the value of this all-important fact; do you realize that a recognition of this tremendous fact places you in touch with Omnipotence? The subconscious mind being the connecting link between the Universal Mind and the conscious mind, is it not evident that the conscious mind can consciously suggest thoughts which the subconscious mind will put into action, and as the subconscious is one with the Universal, is it not evident that no limit can be placed upon its activities? 你現在能否領會，這項極度重要的事實有多彌足珍貴？是否明白，認知這項事實將讓你與全能者建立聯繫？潛意識是連接宇宙心智和顯意識之間的管道，顯意識可以有意識地引導思想，潛意識則是負責將思想融入行為中，難道這一點不是顯而易見的嗎？那麼，既然潛意識與宇宙合而為一，它的活動豈不是也就毫不受限嗎？
23. A scientific understanding of this principle will explain the wonderful results which are secured through the power of prayer. The results which are secured in this way are not brought about by any special dispensations of providence, but on the contrary, they are the result of the operation of a perfectly natural law. There is, therefore, nothing either religious or mysterious about it. 我們若是能發揮科學頭腦領悟這項原理，就可以充分解釋，為什麼單單祈禱就可以獲得神奇結果。我們採用這種方式獲取這些結果並非上帝垂憐，正好相反，完全是自然法則完美運行的結果。因此，在這個過程中絲毫不含任何神祕或宗教成分。
24. Yet there are many who are not ready to enter into the discipline necessary to think correctly, even though it is evident that wrong thinking has brought failure. 雖然「錯誤的思考方向將帶來失敗的惡果」是顯而易見的事情，還是有許多人還沒準備好接受極有必要的正確思維訓練。
25. Thought is the only reality; conditions are but the outward manifestations; as the thought changes, all outward or material conditions must change in order to be in harmony with their creator, which is thought. **思想是唯一的現實，境遇不過是外在顯現；一旦思想改變，所有外在的物質境遇也都會隨之改變，以便與它們的創造者保持和諧一致。在此，所謂的創造者就是思想。**
26. But the thought must be clear cut, steady, fixed, definite, unchangeable; you cannot take one step forward and two steps backward, neither can you spend twenty or thirty years of your life building up negative conditions as the result of negative thoughts, and then expect to see them all melt away as the result of fifteen or twenty minutes of right thinking. 不過，思想必須明晰、穩健、堅定、確實，不容變更。你不能進一步退兩步，更不可以浪費二十年、三十年把自己的一生建立在負面思想所創造的負面環境上，卻還奢望只要花個十五分鐘正確思考，就能夠一筆勾銷過去的謬誤。
27. If you enter into the discipline necessary to bring about a radical change in your life, you must do so deliberately, after giving the matter careful thought and full consideration, and then you must allow nothing to interfere with your decision. 假使你有意顛覆自己的人生，想要進行這套必要的訓練，務必刻意為之，除了認真思索，也要徹底考慮這個問題，此外，你不能容許任何事件干擾你的決定。
28. This discipline, this change of thought, this mental attitude will not only bring you the material things which are necessary for your highest and best welfare, but will bring health and harmonious conditions generally. 這套訓練、思想轉變與全新心態將不僅能為你帶來讓你感到幸福的物質財富，更會帶給你整體的健康身心與和諧境遇。
29. If you wish harmonious conditions in your life, you must develop an harmonious mental attitude. 如果你盼望生活中處處可見和諧境遇，首先便應該打造一個和諧的內心世界。
30. Your world without will be a reflection of your world within. 你的外在世界將會是內心世界的折射。
> 31. For your exercise this week, concentrate on Harmony, and when I say concentrate, I mean all that the word implies; concentrate so deeply, so earnestly, that you will be conscious of nothing but harmony. Remember, we learn by doing. Reading these lessons will get you nowhere. It is in the practical application that the value consists. 本週，你的作業便是專注在「和諧」。我所說的「專注」，意指徹底、完全聚精會神領會一切內在意涵。請務必全心全意、集中所有注意力在「和諧」上，直到心中別無他物。請謹記，唯有透過實踐才能學會。僅僅是閱讀這些課程，不會對你產生任何作用；唯有實際應用才能展現這些文字的真實價值。
