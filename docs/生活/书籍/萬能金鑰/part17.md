###### INTRODUCTION

The kind of Deity which a man, consciously or unconsciously, worships, indicates the intellectual status of the worshipper. 一個人會出於自覺或不自覺地崇拜哪一種「神祇」，都足以反映他的心智狀況。

Ask the Indian of God, and he will describe to you a powerful chieftain of a glorious tribe. Ask the Pagan of God, and he will tell you of a God of fire, a God of water, a god of this, that, and the other. 你問印第安人何謂上帝，他會對你描述一位強而有力的部落酋長；你問不信教的異教徒何謂上帝，對方會說是火神、河神，或是天神、地神之類。

Ask the Israelite of God, and he will tell you of the God of Moses, who conceived it expedient to rule by coercive measures; hence, the Ten Commandments. Or of Joshua, who led the Israelites into battle, confiscated property, murdered the prisoners, and laid waste to cities.
The so-called heathen made "graven images" of their Gods, whom they were accustomed to worship, but among the most intelligent, at least, these images were but the visible fulcrums with which they were enabled to mentally concentrate on the qualities which they desired to externalize in their lives. 你問以色列人何謂上帝，他會告訴你先知摩西就是神的僕人，他認為，宣揚上帝的誡令有利於統治，十誡（Ten Commandments）由此誕生。或者他們會說是摩西的助手約書亞，帶領以色列人發動戰爭、徵收財產、擄殺戰囚，並將城市夷為平地。所謂的蠻族會為自己崇拜的神祇「雕塑形像」，好用來伏地跪拜，不過至少對眾多信徒中最有智慧的少數人來說，這些雕像只是精神支點、實體可見的外在形象，用以寄託自身的靈魂。

We of the twenty-first century worship a God of Love in theory, but in practice we make for ourselves "graven images" of "Wealth," "Power," "Fashion," "Custom" and "Conventionality." We "fall down" before them and worship them. We concentrate on them and they are thereby externalized in our lives. 理論上，我們這些生活在二十一世紀的人是尊崇充滿愛的上帝，但實際上我們也為自己雕刻「財富」、「權力」、「時尚」、「風俗」、「傳統」等形象，並因此「臣服」在它們腳下崇拜。我們全神貫注在它們身上，因此它們也得以在我們的生命中具體化。

The student who masters the contents of Part Seventeen will not mistake the symbols for the reality; he will be interested in causes, rather than effects. He will concentrate on the realities of life, and will then not be disappointed in the results. 熟讀本週課程的學員將不會一再把表象誤認為實體，而是改為關注起因，並且不再重視後果；他們會專心過好每一天的生活，不再為結果患得患失。

###### PART SEVENTEEN

1. We are told that Man has "dominion over all things"; this dominion is established through Mind. Thought is the activity which controls every principle beneath it. The highest principle by reason of its superior essence and qualities necessarily determines the circumstances, aspects and relation of everything with which it comes in contact. 我們學到，人類擁有「支配萬物」的能力，這種支配權建立在心智力量的基礎上。思想是一種活動，掌控在它轄下的所有原則。在本質上、屬性上都凌駕其他原則的最高層次原則，必然能決定所有與它相關的環境、態勢與任何與它相關的萬事萬物。
2. The vibrations of Mental forces are the finest and consequently the most powerful in existence. To those who perceive the nature and transcendency of mental force, all physical power sinks into insignificance. 心靈力量的共振最為純粹，因此是現存力量中最強大的力量。對於那些領悟心靈力量的本質和超然特性的人來說，一切物質的力量皆微不足道。
3. We are accustomed to look upon the Universe with a lens of five senses, and from these experiences our anthropomorphic conceptions originate, but true conceptions are only secured by spiritual insight. This insight requires a quickening of the vibrations of the Mind, and is only secured when the mind is continuously concentrated in a given direction. 我們慣於依賴五種感官觀察宇宙，並由這些經驗發展出所謂人、神觀念；但唯有發揮精神的洞察力才能真正瞭解宇宙。要獲得這種洞察力，除了必須加速心靈的振動，還必須讓心靈持續聚精會神在某個特定議題才能培養而得。
4. Continuous concentration means an even, unbroken flow of thought and is the result of patient, persistent, persevering and well-regulated system. 持之以恆地集中意念，意味著思想應處於一種平衡、不間斷的流動狀態，這樣才能創造一個容忍、持久、堅韌、有序的體系。
5. Great discoveries are the result of long-continued investigation. The science of mathematics requires years of concentrated effort to master it, and the greatest science -- that of the Mind -- is revealed only through concentrated effort. 偉大的發現都是經年累月觀察的結果。學習數學這門科學需要長年集中精力、埋頭鑽研；心智這門最偉大的科學則也非得專心致志、孜孜矻矻研究不可。
6. Concentration is much misunderstood; there seems to be an idea of effort or activity associated with it, when just the contrary is necessary. The greatness of an actor lies in the fact that he forgets himself in the portrayal of his character, becoming so identified with it, that the audience is swayed by the realism of the performance. This will give you a good idea of true concentration; you should be so interested in your thought, so engrossed in your subject, as to be conscious of nothing else. Such concentration leads to intuitive perception and immediate insight into the nature of the object concentrated upon. 許多人對「專注」似乎有所誤解，認為你得先設定好一個努力的目標或活動才能專心，但其實完全相反。傑出的演員之所以能夠神乎其技，成功的關鍵在於演出時完全融入角色，渾然忘我，與扮演的角色融為一體，觀眾自然會為他的真實表演動容。這個例子適切說明何謂真正的專注，因此你應該是完全沉浸在自己的思緒中，深入探索自己的想法，以至於完全不察周遭其他一切毫不相關的事物。這種層次的專注程度將會帶來直覺的感知力、直接的洞察力，讓你能看穿自身關注的對象本質。
7. All knowledge is the result of concentration of this kind; it is thus that the secrets of Heaven and Earth have been wrested; it is thus that the mind becomes a magnet and the desire to know draws the knowledge, irresistibly attracts it, makes it your own. 所有知識都是專注的產物，關於天地間的奧祕就是透過這種方式獲得的：心智變成了一塊磁石，為你求知的渴望引來了智慧，並讓它成為你的資產。
8. Desire is largely subconscious; conscious desire rarely realizes its object when the latter is out of immediate reach. Subconscious desire arouses the latent faculties of the mind, and difficult problems seem to solve themselves. 渴望多半隱身於潛意識，顯意識的渴望鮮少在客觀世界中實現，除非這個渴望可以立刻實現。潛意識的渴望會喚醒心智的潛能，讓難題自然迎刃而解。
9. The subconscious mind may be aroused and brought into action in any direction and made to serve us for any purpose, by concentration. The practice of concentration requires the control of the physical, mental, and physical being; all modes of consciousness whether physical, mental, or physical, must be under control. 透過專注，可以喚醒潛意識的力量，使其依照指示行動，協助我們達成目標。專注力的訓練需要能掌控生理、心理和肉體的本質。所有潛意識──包括生理、心理和肉體在內──都必須掌握在自己手中。
10. Spiritual Truth is therefore the controlling factor; it is this which will enable you to grow out of limited attainment and reach a point where you will be able to translate modes of thought into character and consciousness. 因此，是否能夠體悟心靈的真理，決定了你能不能擺脫有限成就，達到將思想模式轉化為人格特質和意識的全新境界。
11. Concentration does not mean mere thinking of thoughts, but the transmutation of these thoughts into practical values; the average person has no conception of the meaning of concentration. There is always the cry "to have" but never the cry "to be"; they fail to understand that they cannot have one without the other, that they must first find the "kingdom" before they can have the "things added." Momentary enthusiasm is of no value; it is only with unbounded self-confidence that the goal is reached. 專注不是意味著光是動腦筋思考而已，也是指將這些想法化為實用價值的轉變過程。一般人往往不理解專注的真正概念，因此常嚷著「想要擁有」，卻從不渴求「成就自我」。他們多半不明白，兩者其實是相輔相成、密不可分，也就是說，你在覓得「身外之物」之前必得先找到自己的「領地」。三分鐘熱度毫無價值可言，唯有先打造強大自信才能實現目標。
12. The mind may place the ideal a little too high and fall short of the mark; it may attempt to soar on untrained wings and instead of flying, fall to earth; but that is no reason for not making another attempt. 心智可能會將理想定得很高，後來發現自己力有未逮；可能像是羽毛還沒長滿就想一飛沖天的雛鳥，結果遨遊天際不成，反倒摔得鼻青臉腫。不過這些都不能成為我們拒絕重新嘗試的藉口。
13. Weakness is the only barrier to mental attainment; attribute your weakness to physical limitations or mental uncertainties and try again; ease and perfection are gained by repetition. 軟弱可說是心智成長的唯一障礙。把你的軟弱歸咎於生理局限或精神的不確定因素，然後從頭再來一次，只要不斷練習就能輕鬆掌握、臻至完美的境界。
14. The astronomer centers his mind on the stars and they give forth their secrets; the geologists centers his mind on the construction of the earth and we have geology; so with all things. Men center their minds on the problems of life, and the result is apparent in the vast and complex social order of the day. 天文學家專心致志緊盯著星體不放，因而發現天體的奧祕；地質學家心無旁騖地鑽研地下底層構造，從此我們有了地質學；其他學科亦然。人類全神貫注地解決人生的重大問題，才造就今日龐大、複雜的社會結構。
15. All mental discovery and attainment are the result of desire plus concentration; desire is the strongest mode of action; the more persistent the desire, the more authoritative the revelation. Desire added to concentration will wrench any secret from nature. 所有心智層面的發現與成就都源於熱切的渴望，再加上專注所致。渴望是最強而有力的行為模式，渴望越是堅持，獲得的發現就越值得信賴。渴望加上專注，將有助於我們揭開自然界的所有祕密。
16. In realizing great thoughts, in experiencing great emotions that correspond with great thoughts, the mind is in a state where it appreciates the value of higher things. 在實現偉大想法時，當體驗到與偉大想法一致的各種美好感受時，人的心智會進入一種狀態，讓我們能夠鑑賞更高層次事物的價值。
17. The intensity of one moment's earnest concentration and the intense longing to become and to attain may take you further than years of slow normal and forced effort; it will unfasten the prison bars of unbelief, weakness, impotence and self-belittlement, and you will come into a realization of the joy of overcoming. 若能高度集中意念，加上對成為某種人、獲取某種事物的強烈渴望，就算只有短時間，所產生的力量能夠為你帶來的進展，極有可能比你花費數年緩慢且被動的努力付出更有成效。這種渴望能解放疑惑、軟弱、無力、自卑的枷鎖，你將因此體驗到克服自身弱點所帶來的樂趣。
18. The spirit of initiative and originality is developed through persistence and continuity of mental effort. Business teaches the value of concentration and encourages decision of character; it develops practical insight and quickness of conclusion. The mental element in every commercial pursuit is dominant as the controlling factor, and desire is the predominating force; all commercial relations are the externalization of desire. 透過堅持不懈、持之以恆的心理努力，你可以培育出自身的獨創性和進取精神。商業活動中強調「專注」的價值，並推崇果斷決策的性格；經商可以培育實際的洞察力和敏銳的推論能力。每一樁商業活動中都可窺見心智元素在其間運作，而且是占據主導地位；在交易過程中，渴望就是一股前導力量，所有商業關係都是理想的體現。
19. Many of the sturdy and substantial virtues are developed in commercial employment; the mind is steadied and directed; it becomes efficient. The principal necessity is the strengthening of the mind so that it rises superior to the distractions and wayward impulses of instinctive life and thus successfully overcomes in the conflict between the higher and lower self. 商業行為會孕育出許多重要的美德，可以明確且穩定地引導心智的發展，使心靈的運作更有成效。對一個人而言，最重要的便是強化心智，使它可以超越一切讓人分心的事物與各種的本能衝動，進而克服高層次自我（Higher Self）與低層次自我（Lower Self）之間的衝突。
20. All of us are dynamos, but the dynamo of itself is nothing; the mind must work the dynamo; then it is useful and its energy can be definitely concentrated. The mind is an engine whose power is undreamed; thought is an omni-working power. It is the ruler and creator of all form and all events occurring in form. Physical energy is nothing in comparison with the omnipotence of thought, because thought enables man to harness all other natural power. 我們全都像是一具發電機，但單有機械設備並無法發揮用處，只有心靈才能推動它運轉、使它發揮用處，使它能夠確實產生有效集中的力量。我們的心智好比一具引擎，它的動力巨大到難以想像；思想就是全能的力量，也是所有形式與事物的創造者、統管者。有形世界的任何能量，遠不足與思想的全能力量相提並論，因為思想賦予人類支配一切自然力量的能力。
21. Vibration is the action of thought; it is vibration which reaches out and attracts the material necessary to construct and build. There is nothing mysterious concerning the power of thought; concentration simply implies that consciousness can be focalized to the point where it becomes identified with the object of its attention. As food absorbed is the essence of the body, so the mind absorbs the object of its attention, gives it life and being. 思想以振動的型態運行，向外延伸並吸引那些將思考在有形世界建構出來時所需的一切必要素材。思想的力量沒有任何神祕性可言，專注就是指聚焦意識以期達到與關注對象合而為一的程度。我們的身體若想維持生命力就需要攝入食物，心智亦然，也需要吸收它所關注的事物，這樣才能獲得生命力並成長茁壯。
22. If you concentrate on some matter of importance, the intuitive power will be set in operation, and help will come in the nature of information which will lead to success. 倘若你全神貫注在某一重要事項，直覺的力量就會開始運作，它會幫助你獲得資訊，並指引你邁向成功。
23. Intuition arrives at conclusions without the aid of experience or memory. Intuition often solves problems that are beyond the grasp of the reasoning power. Intuition often comes with a suddenness that is startling; it reveals the truth for which we are searching, so directly that it seems to come from a higher power. Intuition can be cultivated and developed; in order to do this it must be recognized and appreciated; if the intuitive visitor is given a royal welcome when he comes, he will come again; the more cordial the welcome the more frequent his visits will become, but if he is ignored or neglected he will make his visits few and far apart. 直覺無須訴諸經驗或記憶就可以取得答案，通常用來解決超越理性能力範疇的問題。直覺常常像是福至心靈的第六感，讓你驚喜萬分；它往往直截了當地揭露我們尋求許久的真理，就像是天外飛來一筆的靈感。直覺可以培養、開發，你若想培養直覺，就有必要認識它、欣賞它。倘若有一天它翩然而降，請提供接待皇室一般的隆重禮儀，如此一來它就會一再光臨。你越熱忱接待，它就會越頻繁造訪；但你若是視而不見或棄如敝屣，它就會越來越懶得上門，與你漸行漸遠。
24. Intuition usually comes in the Silence; great minds seek solitude frequently; it is here that all the larger problems of life are worked out. For this reason every businessman who can afford it has a private office, where he will not be disturbed; if you cannot afford a private office you can at least find somewhere, where you can be alone a few minutes each day, to train the thought along lines which will enable you to develop that invincible power which is necessary to achieve. **直覺一向是來無影、去無蹤，偉大心智常常喜歡獨處，人生一切複雜困難的問題，在靜默獨處的狀態下往往可以得到解答。**為此，所有能力出眾的生意人多半都會擁有一間個人專屬辦公室，好讓他得以隔絕外界干擾；你若是負擔不起個人辦公室，至少可以找到每天都能獨處幾分鐘的據點，在此訓練自己的思維，以培養無敵的力量，它是你實現成就的必要元素。
25. Remember that fundamentally the subconscious is omnipotent; there is no limit to the things that can be done when it is given the power to act. Your degree of success is determined by the nature of your desire. If the nature of your desire is in harmony with Natural Law or the Universal Mind, it will gradually emancipate the mind and give you invincible courage. 請謹記，潛意識基本上無所不能，當它被賦予行動力時，就沒有無法完成的事情。你能獲得何等程度的成就取決於你的願望本質，倘若它與自然法則或宇宙心智和諧一致，潛意識就會釋放你的心靈，賦予你戰無不勝的勇氣。
26. Every obstacle conquered, every victory gained, will give you more faith in your power, and you will have greater ability to win. Your strength is determined by your mental attitude; if this attitude is one of success, and is permanently held with an unswerving purpose, you will attract to you from the invisible domain the things you silently demand. 你每獲得一次勝利、每跨越一道障礙，都會讓自己進一步產生更強烈的自信、萌發更強大的力量贏得更多勝利。你的力量取決於自身的心態，要是你展現成功自信的心態，並懷抱不屈不撓的信念，就能從隱不可見的領域，吸引你默默要求的事物。
27. By keeping the thought in mind, it will gradually take tangible form. A definite purpose sets causes in motion which go out in the invisible world and find the material necessary to serve your purpose. 你只要心中牢記這個想法，它就會在客觀世界中逐漸成形。明確的目標會促使起因生成然後對外發展，在隱不可見的世界中為你找到實現目標的必要素材。
28. You may be pursuing the symbols of power, instead of power itself. You may be pursuing fame instead of honor, riches instead of wealth, position instead of servitude; in either event you will find that they turn to ashes just as you overtake them. 你可能正在追求代表力量的象徵而非力量本身；你可能在追求名聲而非榮譽；可能是金錢而非財富；可能是地位而非主導權。不管是哪一種狀況，一旦你追到手之後很可能會發現，這些都不過是稍縱即逝的身外之物而已。
29. Premature wealth or position cannot be retained because it has not been earned; we get only what we give, and those who try to get without giving always find that the law of compensation is relentlessly bringing about an exact equilibrium. 我們無法留住過早出現的財富或地位，因為它不是你親手辛苦掙來的成就。我們唯有先付出才能有所得。奢望不勞而獲的人總是會發現，補償原則會無情地運行，「天下沒有白吃的午餐」必然維持精準的平衡。
30. The race has usually been for money and other mere symbols of power, but with an understanding of the true source of power, we can afford to ignore the symbols. The man with a large bank account finds it unnecessary to load his pockets down with gold; so with the man who has found the true source of power; he is no longer interested in its shams or pretentions. 金錢與其他權勢的象徵一向就是人們熱中追逐的目標，不過你要是能體悟真正的權力之源，便無須牽掛上述事物。銀行帳戶有大量存款的人會發現，根本不必在口袋裡揣著沉甸甸的黃金；同理，找到真正力量之源的人也不會對經過粉飾的權力或贗品產生任何興趣。
31. Thought ordinarily leads outwardly in evolutionary directions, but it can be turned within where it will take hold of the basic principles of things, the heart of things, the spirit of things. When you get to the heart of things it is comparatively easy to understand and command them. 思想時常招致外在世界發生變革，但你若把矛頭對準內在世界，它就會把握一切事物的基本準則、萬事萬物的核心與精神。一旦你能掌握萬事萬物的核心本質，相較之下就會比較容易理解並活用它們。
32. This is because the Spirit of a thing is the thing itself, the vital part of it, the real substance. The form is simply the outward manifestation of the spiritual activity within. 因為，事物的精神就是事物本身，是其核心部分與真實存在。任何有形實體只是內在世界的靈性活動在外在世界轉化呈現的樣貌。
> 33. For your exercise this week concentrate as nearly as possible in accordance with the method outlined in this lesson; let there be no conscious effort or activity associated with your purpose. Relax completely, avoid any thought of anxiety as to results. Remember that power comes through repose. Let the thought dwell upon your object, until it is completely identified with it, until you are conscious of nothing else. 本週，你的練習作業就是根據本週課程所傳授的方法，盡可能做到專注。不要為了達成某一特定目標而刻意去做什麼，請徹頭徹尾放輕鬆，不用為了結果好壞而焦慮。請謹記，力量源於放鬆。請讓思想圍繞著目標輕柔擺盪，直到與它完全合而為一、直到你渾然不察周遭事物。
> 34. If you wish to eliminate fear, concentrate on courage. 如果你希望消除恐懼，就請聚焦勇氣。
> 35. If you wish to eliminate lack, concentrate on abundance. 如果你希望消除匱乏，就請聚焦富足。
> 36. If you wish to eliminate disease, concentrate on health. 如果你希望消除疾病，就請聚焦健康。
> 37. Always concentrate on the ideal as an already existing fact; this is the germ cell, the life principle which goes forth and sets in motion those causes which guide, direct and bring about the necessary relation, which eventually manifest in form. 永遠專注在最理想的狀態，就如同它已經實現了那般。這樣的思想就像是一顆生殖細胞，是誘發起因，並促成行動的生命原則；一旦這些起因開始運作，就會引導、指揮並建立各種必要的連結，最終使你的目標轉化為實體。
