##### INTRODUCTION 

Through all the ages man has believed in an invisible power, through which and by which all things have been created and are continually being re-created. 幾百年來，人們相信冥冥中存在一股看不見的力量，萬物都是由此孕育而生，因此這個世界才能生生不息、周而復始。

We may personalize this power and call it God, or we may think of it as the essence or spirit, which permeates all things, but in either case the effect is the same. 我們可能人格化這道力量並稱之為上帝；我們也可能認定它是萬物本質或精神，但萬變不離其宗，孕育萬物這一點是一樣的。

So far as the individual is concerned, the objective, the physical, the visible, is the personal, that which can be cognized by the senses. It consists of body, brain and nerves. The subjective is the spiritual, the invisible, the impersonal. 就個體而言，客觀的、有實體的、可見的實物是屬於個人的，都可透過感官認知。感官包括身體、大腦和神經網絡；而主觀的部分是心靈的、看不見的，不具個人的事物。

The personal is conscious because it is a personal entity. The impersonal, being the same in kind and quality as all other Being, is not conscious of itself and has therefore been termed the subconscious. The personal, or conscious, has the power of will and choice, and can therefore exercise discrimination in the selection of methods whereby to bring about the solution of difficulties. The impersonal, or spiritual, being a part or one with the source, and origin of all power, can necessarily exercise no such choice, but, on the contrary, it has Infinite resources at its command. It can and does bring about results by methods concerning which the human or individual mind can have no possible conception. 人的形體是有形的實體，因此具有意識；而非實體的、靈性的部分儘管擁有與一切實體相同的屬性，卻無法意識自身存在，因此我們稱之為「潛意識」。人的形體，或說自覺意識，擁有意志力、選擇力，因此遭遇困難時可以發揮判斷力，從各種解決方法中挑揀出合用之道。人的非實體，或說靈性部分，卻是萬物起源的一部分，它沒有選擇的能力，然而它可以任意支配「無限」這項資源，而且可以藉由人類或個人心智無法想像的方法實現目的。

You will therefore see that it is your privilege to depend upon the human will with all its limitations and misconceptions, or you may utilize the potentialities of Infinity by making use of the subconscious mind. Here, then, is the scientific explanation of the wonderful power which has been put within your control, if you but understand, appreciate and recognize it. 因此，你會發現，你可以繼續倚賴處處受限、謬誤連連的人類意志，也可以發揮潛意識心智的力量，開發無限潛能。接下來的課程就是要套用科學思維詳盡闡述這股神奇的力量。其實只要你有心理解、欣賞並認同，它就盡在你的掌握中。
One method of consciously utilizing this omnipotent power is outlined in Part Seven. 本週將為你說明如何自發自覺地善用這股無所不能的力量。

##### PART SEVEN

1. Visualization is the process of making mental images, and the image is the mold or model which will serve as a pattern from which your future will emerge. 「視覺化想像」（Visualization）是打造意象的過程，你所描繪的精神圖像就是一套模具或模型，你未來的人生將依此為範本而形塑。
2. Make the pattern clear and make it beautiful; do not be afraid; make it grand; remember that no limitation can be placed upon you by any one but yourself; you are not limited as to cost or material; draw on the Infinite for your supply, construct it in your imagination; it will have to be there before it will ever appear anywhere else. **你要保持心中的精神圖像細緻而美好，切勿害怕退縮。請描繪出一幅宏偉壯觀的景象；請謹記，除了你自己，沒有人可以限制羈絆你。**你無須受限於金錢或素材，你能從無限力量中汲取所需能量，任憑想像力帶你建構出人生的樣本；它必須先在想像世界裡落地生根，才可能在別的地方付諸實現。
3. Make the image clear and clean-cut, hold it firmly in the mind and you will gradually and constantly bring the thing nearer to you. You can be what "you will to be." 請讓這幅圖像清晰無瑕、輪廓鮮明，讓它在你心中牢牢地落地生根，這樣你必能一步接一步，持之以恆地更向目標靠近。你可以成為「自己夢寐以求想成為的那個人」。
4. This is another psychological fact which is well known, but unfortunately, reading about it will not bring about any result which you may have in mind; it will not even help you to form the mental image, much less bring it into manifestation. Work is necessary - labor, hard mental labor, the kind of effort which so few are willing to put forth. 這是另一個眾所周知的心理學事實，遺憾的是，單單只是知道這個事實對你的心智其實毫無裨益，甚至無法幫助你描繪你的心靈圖像，更遑論實現目標。付出努力是不可避免的，但是很少人願意如此勞心、勞力。
5. The first step is idealization. It is likewise the most important step, because it is the plan on which you are going to build. It must be solid; it must be permanent. The architect, when he plans a 30-story building, has every line and detail pictured in advance. The engineer, when he spans a chasm, first ascertains the strength requirements of a million separate parts. 第一個步驟就是「**理想化**」（Idealization），這是最重要的步驟。因為無論你希望打造出什麼成果，必得奠基於藍圖。理想必須實際堅定、禁得起考驗。好比建築師在計劃興蓋一棟三十層高樓時，必得事先仔細繪製每一條線、每一個細節。當工程師打算開挖深渠之前，必得先計算出這項工程所需數以百萬計的零組件的承載力。
6. They see the end before a single step is taken; so you are to picture in your mind what you want; you are sowing the seed, but before sowing any seed you want to know what the harvest is to be. This is Idealization. If you are not sure, return to the chair daily until the picture becomes plain; it will gradually unfold; first the general plan will be dim, but it will take shape, the outline will take form, then the details, and you will gradually develop the power by which you will be enabled to formulate plans which will eventually materialize in the objective world. You will come to know what the future holds for you. **他們在實際邁出第一步之前就已預先看到最終結果，所以你也得在腦中先構思出自己渴望的目標。就跟種植作物一樣，如果你正要播種，在撒下任何種籽以前就要先知道自己將會收穫什麼作物。這就是理想化的過程。**倘若你還沒有十足把握，那就回到你每天練習的座位上，每天花時間思考，直到這幅圖像清晰可見為止。它會一步步慢慢開展，首先是隱約模糊的總體規劃，但雛形已具、輪廓已明；再來就是諸多細節，你將慢慢發展出所需力量，以便在過程中一步步形塑你的計畫，直到最後可以在有形的物質世界中實現。你將知道，未來你可以擁有什麼。
7. Then comes the process of visualization. You must see the picture more and more complete, see the detail, and, as the details begin to unfold the ways and means for bringing it into manifestation will develop. One thing will lead to another. Thought will lead to action, action will develop methods, methods will develop friends, and friends will bring about circumstances, and, finally, the third step, or Materialization, will have been accomplished. 接下來，就是「**視覺化想像**」這個過程。你在心中看到的畫面必須越來越清晰完整，隨著各項細節在你眼前一一開展，使其實現的種種方法與手段也會隨之浮現，環環相扣。想法會引領行動，行動會產生方法，方法會呼朋引伴，志同道合的朋友則會改變你的境遇，最終敦促你邁入第三道步驟，也就是**實體化**（Materialization）。到了這一步，你的目標也就達成了。
8. We all recognize the Universe must have been thought into shape before it ever could have become a material fact. And if we are willing to follow along the lines of the Great Architect of the Universe, we shall find our thoughts taking form, just as the universe took concrete form. It is the same mind operating through the individual. There is no difference in kind or quality, the only difference is one of degree. 我們都明白，宇宙必定是先在思想中成形，之後才會形成實體。如果我們願意主動順著偉大宇宙建築師所設定的這條道路前行，有一天會發現自己的思想也會像宇宙的物質化為實體那般，成為有形的實體。個人的心智運作與此過程並無二致，毫無所謂種類、性質的差異，唯獨程度有別。
9. The architect visualizes his building, he sees it as he wishes it to be. His thought becomes a plastic mold from which the building will eventually emerge, a high one or a low one, a beautiful one or a plain one, his vision takes form on paper and eventually the necessary material is utilized and the building stands complete. 建築師會先對他要設計的建物進行視覺化想像，也就是說在腦海中看見他希望落成的實物。他的思想就像是一副模具，無論是高樓或平房、美輪美奐或是平淡無奇，整棟建物最終就是誕生於這副模具中。他在心中描繪的願景必是先躍然紙上，最後透過必需的物質建材，蓋出一棟完工的建築。
10. The inventor visualizes his idea in exactly the same manner, for instance, Nikola Tesla, he with the giant intellect, one of the greatest inventors of all ages, the man who has brought forth the most amazing realities, always visualizes his inventions before attempting to work them out. He did not rush to embody them in form and then spend his time in correcting defects. Having first built up the idea in his imagination, he held it there as a mental picture, to be reconstructed and improved by his thought. "In this way," he writes in the Electrical Experimenter. "I am enabled to rapidly develop and perfect a conception without touching anything. When I have gone so far as to embody in the invention every possible improvement I can think of, and see no fault anywhere, I put into concrete, the product of my brain. Invariably my devise works as I conceived it should; in twenty years there has not been a single exception." 發明家也懂得採取同樣手法視覺化自己的理念。舉例來說，天才科學家尼古拉．特斯拉（Nikola Tesla）可謂有史以來最偉大的發明家之一，他天賦異稟，經常創造出讓世人嘆為觀止的奇蹟。在他實際動手創造之前，會先視覺化目標。他不會急著把想像具體化，而是慢慢地費工夫修正缺陷。一開始他會先天馬行空地想像，逐步建立起理念，然後描繪出一幅精神圖像，在想像的世界裡動腦思考，重新組構，進行細部的改進。「我採用這種方式，」他在雜誌《電力實驗者》（*Electrical Experimenter*）中這麼寫，「因而得以在不用動手碰任何物件的情況下，快速地把一個概念發展到完美的境界。當我終於進行到可以設計出腦中想像的物件，而且再也想不到任何一丁點需要改進的弱點，也找不到一絲一毫的缺陷時，才會動手將腦子裡的產品付諸實現。我所設計、製作的產品最終總是與我當初所設想的形體一模一樣，二十年來從無例外。」
11. If you can conscientiously follow these directions, you will develop Faith, the kind of Faith that is the "Substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen"; you will develop confidence, the kind of confidence that leads to endurance and courage; you will develop the power of concentration which will enable you to exclude all thoughts except the ones which are associated with your purpose. 如果你可以自發自覺地遵循這些指示，就可以發展出信念，也就是《新約》中所謂「信就是所望之事的實底、是未見之事的確據」。你將培養出自信，即一股可以帶來毅力和勇氣的信心，這種自信將為你帶來專注力，得以排除一切雜念，集中思想在與目標相關的一切事物上。
12. The law is that thought will manifest in form, and only one who knows how to be the divine thinker of his own thoughts can ever take a Master's place and speak with authority. 有一個法則這麼說：「思想得以化為有形實體」，唯有懂得如何善用思想成為卓越思想家之人，才得以坐上大師的地位，帶著權威說話。
13. Clearness and accuracy are obtained only by repeatedly having the image in mind. Each repeated action renders the image more clear and accurate than the preceding, and in proportion to the clearness and accuracy of the image will the outward manifestation be. You must build it firmly and securely in your mental world, the world within, before it can take form in the world without, and you can build nothing of value, even in the mental world unless you have the proper material. When you have the material you can build anything you wish, but make sure of your material. You cannot make broadcloth from shoddy. 唯有持續在腦子裡一再描繪這幅圖像，才能提升它的清晰度與準確度。每一次的重複都會使圖像變得比之前更清晰明確。**心靈圖像的清晰準確程度與它****在****有形世界的狀況互成正比。**你必須先讓它在自己的心靈世界，也就是內在世界中牢牢地落地生根，它才會在外在的有形世界中成為實體。除非你找到適合的材料，否則就算在心靈世界裡也打造不出任何有價值的東西。雖然只要有材料就一定可以做出些什麼，但請務必確保材料的品質優良。因為你不可能用劣質材料做出上等貨。
14. This material will be brought out by millions of silent mental workers and fashioned into the form of the image which you have in mind. 在你的內在世界中，有數百萬名無聲的建築工人會將這種建材源源不絕運送到場，打造出你心中的精神圖像。
15. Think of it! You have over five million of these mental workers, ready and in active use; brain cells they are called. Besides this, there is another reserve force of at least an equal number, ready to be called into action at the slightest need. Your power to think, then, is almost unlimited, and this means that your power to create the kind of material which is necessary to build for yourself any kind of environment which you desire is practically unlimited. 試想看看！你的心靈世界中有五百萬個精神建築工在努力工作著，他們的名字就是腦細胞。除此之外，你還有一批至少相同數量的工人，隨時等著被徵召，接手完成任務。由此看來，你的思考能力無遠弗屆，這也意味著你的創造力同樣無遠弗屆，足以為你創造出自身渴望的外在環境。
16. In addition to these millions of mental workers, you have billions of mental workers in the body, every one of which is endowed with sufficient intelligence to understand and act upon any message or suggestion given. These cells are all busy creating and recreating the body, but, in addition to this, they are endowed with psychic activity whereby they can attract to themselves the substance necessary for perfect development. 除了大腦中這一批精神建築工，你的體內其他部位也有數十億的精神建築工，每一名都具備足夠的智慧，能夠理解並根據接收到的訊息或建議行事。這些細胞馬不停蹄地創造然後再重塑我們的身體，除此之外，他們還可以進行一種靈性活動，也就是把完善目標建物所需的物質吸引過來。
17. They do this by the same law and in the same manner that every form of life attracts to itself the necessary material for growth. The oak, the rose, the lily, all require certain material for their most perfect expression and they secure it by silent demand, the Law of Attraction, the most certain way for you to secure what you require for your most complete development. 這些工人吸引所需物質時遵循的法則，與各種形態的生命吸引其成長所需材料時遵循的法則與方式完全相同。橡樹、玫瑰與百合等植物為了展現完美之姿，都需要特定的物質材料，它們無聲中透過吸引力法則索求，因此獲得所需的材料。因此，如果你想要完美無瑕地發展自身，吸引力法則正是你獲取所需材料的最可靠途徑。
18. Make the Mental Image; make it clear, distinct, perfect; hold it firmly; the ways and means will develop; supply will follow the demand; you will be led to do the right thing at the right time and in the right way. Earnest Desire will bring about Confident Expectation, and this in turn must be reinforced by Firm Demand. These three cannot fail to bring about Attainment, because the Earnest Desire is the feeling, the Confident Expectation is the thought, and the Firm Demand is the will, and, as we have seen, feeling gives vitality to thought and the will holds it steadily until the law of Growth brings it into manifestation. 把精神圖像描繪得明確、完美，並在心中請牢牢抓住它，方法和手段便會隨之而來，供給也會隨著需求而來。你將會收到指引，在正確的時間採取正確的方式實現正確的事情。「熱切的渴望」會帶來「確信的期待」，而「確信的期待」需要「堅定的要求」進一步強化。這三者必能帶來任何成就，因為「熱切的渴望」就是我們的感覺，「確信的期待」就是我們的想法，而「堅定的要求」就是我們的意志力。正如我們所知，感覺賦予想法活力，意志力則讓它堅定不移，讓「成長法則」將願景化為現實。
19. Is it not wonderful that man has such tremendous power within himself, such transcendental faculties concerning which he had no conception? Is it not strange that we have always been taught to look for strength and power "without?" We have been taught to look everywhere but "within" and whenever this power manifested in our lives we were told that it was something supernatural. 我們人類體內具備如此沛然的力量、如此超脫自然的能力，但我們卻一直渾然不覺，這一點不是匪夷所思嗎？總是會有人指點我們要從「外在世界」尋求力量和能力，這一點不是也荒謬可笑嗎？我們一直被教育著要從「內在世界」以外的各個角落尋找力量，一旦這股力量真的從我們的生命煥發出來，他們卻又會告訴我們，這其實是超自然的現象。
20. There are many who have come to an understanding of this wonderful power, and who make serious and conscientious efforts to realize health, power and other conditions, and seem to fail. They do not seem able to bring the Law into operation. The difficulty in nearly every case is that they are dealing with externals. They want money, power, health and abundance, but they fail to realize that these are effects and can come only when the cause is found. 許多人已經體會到這股神奇力量，因此認真、自發自覺地努力獲取健康、力量及其他外部條件，最終卻仍功虧一簣。他們似乎無法妥善地運作這項法則的能力。之所以會造成這結果，都是因為他們只知道要和「外在世界」打交道，他們索求金錢、權力、健康、財富，卻不知道這些都是「後果」而已，但我們唯有先找到「起因」，才能讓「後果」水到渠成。
21. Those who will give no attention to the world without will seek only to ascertain the truth, will look only for wisdom, will find that this wisdom will unfold and disclose the source of all power, that it will manifest in thought and purpose which will create the external conditions desired. This truth will find expression in noble purpose and courageous action. 一個人若能不去注意外在世界，而是專注於查明真理、尋求智慧，他們會發現，智慧活生生就在眼前，向他們敞開力量之源，也會發現，智慧就展現在他們的想法和目標中，最終為他們開創自己一心渴望的外在境遇。這偉大的真理會在高貴的目標和勇敢的行動中彰顯出來。
22. Create ideals only, give no thought to external conditions, make the world within beautiful and opulent and the world without will express and manifest the condition which you have within. You will come into a realization of your power to create ideals and these ideals will be projected into the world of effect. 你只要專注於內在想法，而非外在環境，只要能把內在世界塑造得美麗、富饒，外在世界自然會體現你的內在世界所呈現的狀態。你會發現，你所創造的想法，最終會投射呈現在客觀世界，成為結果。
23. For instance, a man is in debt. He will be continually thinking about the debt, concentrating on it, and as thoughts are causes the result is that he not only fastens the debt closer to him, but actually creates more debt. He is putting the great law of Attraction into operation with the usual and inevitable result -- Loss leads to greater "Loss." 舉例來說，有個人債台高築，他因此茶不思、飯不想地惦記著這筆債，心心念念只想著它。這些想法因此成為起因，最終後果便是，他不僅更被債務逼得喘不過氣來，甚至還背負了更多債。他把吸引力法則應用在這方面，便得到司空見慣且無可避免的結果，也就是「輸者恆輸」。
24. What, then, is the correct principle? Concentrate on the things you want, not on the things you do not want. Think of abundance; idealize the methods and plans for putting the Law of Abundance into operation. Visualize the condition which the Law of Abundance creates; this will result in manifestation. 這麼說來，什麼才是正確的法則？答案是，聚焦在你想要的目標，而非你不想要的事物。你應該全心想著富足的境況，在心中描繪最理想的方法和計畫，啟動富足法則的運行。在你的內在世界中描繪富足法則所創造的美好情境，這麼做將會讓你實現富足的現實生活。
25. If the law operates perfectly to bring about poverty, lack and every form of limitation for those who are continually entertaining thoughts of lack and fear, it will operate with the same certainty to bring about conditions of abundance and opulence for those who entertain thoughts of courage and power. 對於一天到晚都懷抱著匱乏與恐懼念頭的人來說，這套法則就會為他們帶來窮困潦倒、匱乏不足與各種限制，對於心中常存勇氣和力量的人來說，它則會為他們帶來富足與豐饒。
26. This is a difficult problem for many; we are too anxious; we manifest anxiety, fear, distress; we want to do something; we want to help; we are like a child who has just planted a seed and every fifteen minutes goes and stirs up the earth to see if it is growing. Of course, under such circumstances, the seed will never germinate, and yet this is exactly what many of us do in the mental world. 大部分人都有相同的問題。我們過度焦慮，我們經常憂心忡忡、恐懼、沮喪，我們希望做出一點成績，我們想要提供幫助。我們就好似孩童一樣，種下一顆種籽，然後每隔十五分鐘就要探頭看看，翻一翻土壤，看看它有沒有長大。當然，在這種情況下，種籽永遠別想發芽生長，但這就是我們許多人對內在世界幹的蠢事。
27. We must plant the seed and leave it undisturbed. This does not mean that we are to sit down and do nothing, by no means; we will do more and better work then we have ever done before, new channels will constantly be provided, new doors will open; all that is necessary is to have an open mind, be ready to act when the time comes. 我們必須種下種籽，但也得放手不干擾它成長。這不是說我們乾脆就坐下來等，什麼事也不幹；我們反而應該比以前多做一點，而且要做得更好一點，因為全新的管道將源源不絕地供應，一扇全新的大門也將為我們敞開；我們必須做的事就是開放心胸，隨時做好準備，一等時機成熟便採取行動。
28. Thought force is the most powerful means of obtaining knowledge, and if concentrated on any subject will solve the problem. Nothing is beyond the power of human comprehension, but in order to harness thought force and make it do your bidding, work is required. 思想的力量是獲取知識最強而有力的手段，假設我們專注在問題上，任何問題都能迎刃而解。沒有什麼事會超出人類的理解力，但你得付出努力，才能想駕馭思想的力量，讓它聽命於你行事。
29. Remember that thought is the fire that creates the steam that turns the wheel of fortune, upon which your experiences depend. 請謹記，思想就是火焰，因此會產生蒸汽，推動財富的車輪。你的人生經歷就取決於此。
30. Ask yourself a few questions and then reverently await the response; do you not now and then feel the self with you? Do you assert this self or do you follow the majority? Remember that majorities are always led, they never lead. It was the majority that fought, tooth and nail, against the steam engine, the power loom and every other advance or improvement ever suggested. 請捫心自問幾個問題，並真心誠意地等待答案浮現：你是否時常可以感覺到自我與你同在？你是否能堅持這個自我，還是說你習慣從眾？請謹記，大多數人都是跟隨者，他們從來就不當領頭羊。當年蒸汽機、動力織布機以及其他每一回科技進步和改良的機器設備問世時，竭盡全力頑強反抗的，就是多數群眾。 聚焦在你想要的目標，而非你不想要的事物。

For your exercise this week, visualize your friend, see him exactly as you last saw him, see the room, the furniture, recall the conversation, now see his face, see it distinctly, now talk to him about some subject of mutual interest; see his expression change, watch him smile. Can you do this? All right, you can; then arouse his interest, tell him a story of adventure, see his eyes light up with the spirit of fun or excitement. Can you do all of this? If so, your imagination is good, you are making excellent progress. 這一週你的功課就是在腦中視覺化一位朋友。清楚地看到上一次你與他碰面的狀況──不僅是他的模樣，也要看到房間、家具，還要能想起你們雙方的對話。現在請正視他的臉，仔細清楚地觀察，然後挑一個雙方有共同興趣的話題展開交談，看看他的臉部表情如何變化，觀察他展顏微笑。你做得到嗎？很好，你做得到。現在你開始設法激發他的興趣，告訴他一則冒險故事，看著他的雙眼閃閃發亮，閃爍著興奮開心的光芒。你也能做得到這一點嗎？要是可以的話，那就代表你的想像力非常豐富，你正取得驚人進展。
