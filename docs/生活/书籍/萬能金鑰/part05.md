##### INTRODUCTION 

Enclosed herewith you will find Part Five. After studying this part carefully, you will see that every conceivable force or object or fact is the result of mind in action. “隨函附上第五週的課程。仔細研讀完這一部分後你將會發現：所有力量、物體或事件都是心智活動產生的結果。”

Mind in action is thought, and thought is creative. Men are thinking now as they never thought before. Therefore, this is a creative age, and the world is awarding its richest prizes to the thinkers. 心智活動產生思想，思想具有創造力。這個時代的人類正在思考著前人從未曾想過的事。因此，這是具有創造力的時代，世界會將以最豐厚的獎勵贈與思想者。

Matter is powerless, passive, inert. Mind is force, energy, power. Mind shapes and controls matter. Every form which matter takes is but the expression of some pre-existing thought. 物質本身沒有力量、被動而且了無生氣，精神則代表了動力、能量與權力。精神塑造並掌控物質，物質的任何形態，都只不過是早已存在的思想的一種展現。

But thought works no magic transformations; it obeys natural laws; it sets in motion natural forces; it releases natural energies; it manifests in your conduct and actions, and these in turn react upon your friends and acquaintances, and eventually upon the whole of your environment. 然而，思想運作並非魔法使然，而是遵循自然法則；它推動自然力量的運轉、它釋放自然的能量、它體現在你的所作所為中，從而在你的親朋好友之間產生作用，最終影響你的周遭環境。

You can originate thought, and, since thoughts are creative, you can create for yourself the things you desire. 你有能耐創造思想，而且因為你的想法具有創造性，你還可以為自己創造夢寐以求的一切事物。

##### PART FIVE

1. At least ninety per cent of our mental life is subconscious, so that those who fail to make use of this mental power live within very narrow limits. 我們的心智活動中，至少九○％屬於潛意識範疇，因此，一個人若無法善用精神能量，他的生活將處處受限。
2. The subconscious can and will solve any problem for us if we know how to direct it. The subconscious processes are always at work; the only question is, are we to be simply passive recipients of this activity, or are we to consciously direct the work? Shall we have a vision of the destination to be reached, the dangers to be avoided, or shall we simply drift? 倘若我們知道如何引導潛意識，它就能為我們解決任何問題。潛意識的運作永不停歇，唯一的問題是，我們該被動接受這種單向活動就好，還是應該自發自覺地引導它呢？我們應該要能夠預見未來命運、趨吉避凶，還是隨波逐流就好？
3. We have found that mind pervades every part of the physical body and is always capable of being directed or impressed by authority coming from the objective or the more dominant portion of the mind. 我們早已知道，心智遍布人體的各個部位，總是受到客觀事物或主導性心智的引導或影響。
4. The mind, which pervades the body, is largely the result of heredity, which, in turn, is simply
the result of all the environments of all past generations on the responsive and ever-moving life forces. An understanding of this fact will enable us to use our authority when we find some undesirable trait of character manifesting. 遍布全身的心智絕大部分得自遺傳，這種遺傳來自生生不息的生命力量對每一世代人類和環境反應時所產生的結果。當我們理解這個事實後，一旦發現自己身上出現某種令人不快的性格特質時，就會懂得如何行使我們的權力來改變它。
5. We can consciously use all the desirable characteristics with which we have been provided
and we can repress and refuse to allow the undesirable ones to manifest. 我們可以決定要保留哪些與生俱來討人喜歡的人格特質，同時抑制、拒絕發展那些我們不想要的人格特質。
6. Again, this mind which pervades our physical body is not only the result of hereditary tendencies, but is the result of home, business and social environment, where countless thousands of impressions, ideas, prejudices and similar thoughts have been received. Much of this has been received from others, the result of opinions, suggestions or statements; much of it is the result of our own thinking, but nearly all of it has been accepted with little or no examination or consideration. 我再重申一次，遍布生理軀體的心智不僅來自遺傳，更是家庭、事業、社會環境交互作用的結果。因為心靈會在環境中接受成千上萬個意念、想法、偏見，其中許多都是出自他人的意見、建議或論述；也有不少是自身的想法，而我們往往沒有經過檢驗或再三評估就盲目地照單全收。
7. The idea seemed plausible, the conscious received it, passed it on to the subconscious, where it was taken up by the Sympathetic System and passed on to be built into our physical body. "The word has become flesh." 當我們接收到某個想法，如果這個想法聽起來頗有道理，就會被我們的顯意識接受，然後傳遞給潛意識，繼而又被交感神經系統採納，最後內化在我們的身體中。這就是所謂的「道成肉身」。
8. This, then, is the way we are consistently creating and recreating ourselves; we are today the result of our past thinking, and we shall be what we are thinking today, the Law of Attraction is bringing to us, not the things we should like, or the things we wish for, or the things some one else has, but it brings us "our own," the things which we have created by our thought processes, whether consciously or unconsciously. Unfortunately, many of us are creating these things unconsciously. 我們就是透過這樣的方式，持續創造並再造自我。今日的我們是昨日思考的產物，而明日的我們則是今日思考的結晶。吸引力法則帶給我們的，不是我們應該喜歡或期盼的結果，更非別人所有的事物，而是「我們自己」── 也就是我們自己思考後的心血結晶，在有意或無意下創造的產物。然而不幸的是，大多數人都只是在渾渾噩噩下創造了這些成果。
9. If either of us were building a home for ourselves, how careful we would be in regard to the plans; how we should study every detail; how we should watch the material and select only the best of everything; and yet how careless we are when it comes to building our Mental Home, which is infinitely more important than any physical home, as everything which can possibly enter into our lives depends upon the character of the material which enters into the construction of our Mental Home. 如果我們要為自己打造房舍，肯定會小心翼翼地縝密規劃、鉅細靡遺地研究每一項細節，謹慎小心地挑揀建材，只為找到萬中選一的物件。但當我們打造心靈家園時，竟是如此漫不經心！要知道，心靈家園的重要性遠遠超過實體房舍，我們生活中所經歷與擁有的萬事萬物，完全取決於我們用來建造心靈家園的建材是否品質優良。
10. What is the character of this material? We have seen that it is the result of the impressions which we have accumulated in the past and stored away in our subconscious Mentality. If these impressions have been of fear, of worry, of care, of anxiety; if they have been despondent, negative, doubtful, then the texture of the material which we are weaving today will be of the same negative material. Instead of being of any value, it will be mildewed and rotten and will bring us only more toil and care and anxiety. We shall be forever busy trying to patch it up and make it appear at least genteel. 心靈家園的建材有何特色？是指我們日積月累儲存於潛意識心態中的種種心靈印記。如果這些印記是恐懼、煩惱、憂愁與焦慮的綜合體，如果它們帶有負面、消極、懷疑的本質，那麼我們用來打造心靈家園所用的建材就會帶有同樣的負面質感。這種心靈家園不僅毫無價值，反而會催化我們的生活發霉、鏽蝕，帶給我們更多困擾、煩惱與焦慮。我們最終只能鎮日忙著挖東牆、補西牆，遮遮掩掩只為讓它看起來有模有樣。
11. But if we have stored away nothing but courageous thought, if we have been optimistic, positive, and have immediately thrown any kind of negative thought on the scrap pile, have refused to have anything to do with it, have refused to associate with it or become identified with it in any way, what then is the result? Our mental material is now of the best kind; we can weave any kind of material we want; we can use any color we wish; we know that the texture is firm, that the material is solid, that it will not fade, and we have no fear, no anxiety concerning the future; there is nothing to cover, there are no patches to hide. 然而，如果我們只在潛意識存入勇敢的思想，如果我們常保樂觀、進取，而且只要負面想法一萌芽就立即拋開，並拒絕與它發生任何關連、拒絕任何牽扯或與它同流合污，結果將如何？我們的心靈家園將擁有首屈一指的優良建材，我們可以用它織造任何渴望的材料、可以採用任何喜歡的顏色；我們知道它的質地堅韌、牢固，而且永不褪色；我們望向未來毫無所懼、毫無所憂；沒有什麼事需要遮遮掩掩，也沒有什麼需要修補的缺陷。
12. These are psychological facts; there is no theory or guess work about these thinking processes; there is nothing secret about them; in fact, they are so plain that every one can understand them. The thing to do is to have a mental house-cleaning, and to have this house- cleaning every day, and keep the house clean. Mental, moral and physical cleanliness are absolutely indispensable if we are to make progress of any kind. 這些都是心理學的事實，並非理論或猜測，當中也沒有什麼祕密；事實上，這些道理淺顯得無以復加，每個人一聽就懂。我們必須做的事就是來一場心靈家園大掃除，然後每天都要清掃拂拭，保持整潔乾淨。我們若想要取得任何進步，精神、道德和肉體常保清潔絕對不可或缺。
13. When this mental house-cleaning process has been completed, the material which is left will be suitable for the making of the kind of ideals or mental images which we desire to realize. 一旦我們完成心靈家園大掃除，剩下的建材便很適合用來打造我們渴望實現的理想或精神願景。
14. There is a fine estate awaiting a claimant. Its broad acres, with abundant crops, running water and fine timber, stretch away as far as the eye can see. There is a mansion, spacious and cheerful, with rare pictures, a well-stocked library, rich hangings, and every comfort and luxury. All the heir has to do is to assert his heirship, take possession, and use the property. He must use it; he must not let it decay; for use is the condition on which he holds it. To neglect it is to lose possession. 有一處好山好水等我們據為己有，它有廣袤的田野、豐茂的作物、流淌的溪河與上等的木材，放眼望去一望無際。有一幢華屋美廈寬廣又宜人，屋內有稀世珍畫、豐富藏書、精美幔帳，奢華舒適無可比擬。繼承者只要主張他的財產繼承權，就可以佔有並運用這些資產。他必須盡其活用，絕不能任由荒廢，因為實際使用才是他可以持有的唯一條件；擱置一旁則會使他失去擁有權。
15. In the domain of mind and spirit, in the domain of practical power, such an estate is yours. You are the heir! You can assert your heirship and possess, and use this rich inheritance. Power over circumstances is one of its fruits, health, harmony and prosperity are assets upon its balance sheet. It offers you poise and peace. It costs you only the labor of studying and harvesting its great resources. It demands no sacrifice, except the loss of your limitations, your servitudes, your weakness. It clothes you with self-honor, and puts a scepter in your hands. 在心智、精神、實質力量的領域中，就存在著這一片屬於你的資產。你就是繼承者！你可以主張自己的繼承權、擁有權，並善用這份豐厚的資產。掌控環境的力量就是莊園產出的果實；健康、和諧、繁榮就是資產負債表中的淨資產，供應你安詳與和平，你唯一要付出的代價就只是去研究並收割其中蘊藏的豐富資源。你會失去的就只有過去的種種自我限制、被束縛的奴性，以及軟弱無能。它將為你披上自尊自榮的外袍，並將權杖交到你的手中。
16. To gain this estate, three processes are necessary: You must earnestly desire it. You must assert your claim. You must take possession. 你若想獲得這筆資產，以下三個步驟缺一不可：你必須真誠地渴望它、你必須主張自己的所有權、你必須實際地擁有它。
17. You admit that those are not burdensome conditions. 你應該也同意，上述條件不算苛刻。
18. You are familiar with the subject of heredity. Darwin, Huxley, Haeckel, and other physical scientists have piled evidence mountain high that heredity is a law attending progressive creation. It is progressive heredity which gives man his erect attitude, his power of motion, the organs of digestions, blood circulation, nerve force, muscular force, bone structure and a host of other faculties on the physical side. There are even more impressive facts concerning heredity of mind force. All these constitute what may be called your human heredity. 你對遺傳學說應該耳熟能詳，英國生物學家查爾斯．達爾文（Charles Darwin）、博物學家湯瑪士．赫胥黎（Thomas Huxley）、德國博物學家恩斯特．海克爾（Ernst Haeckel）等自然科學家已經用大量證據，證明演化過程中遺傳法則高居主導地位。人類擁有的直立行走、行動能力、消化器官、血液循環、神經運作、肌肉力量、骨骼結構以及其他許許多多的身體能力，正是一再進化的遺傳所賦予的。在心靈力量這個層面，也存在著諸多驚人的遺傳現象。這些構成了我們所謂的「人類遺傳」。
19. But there is a heredity which the physical scientists have not compassed. It lies beneath and antecedent to all their researches. At a point where they throw up their hands in despair, saying they cannot account for what they see, this divine heredity is found in full sway. 然而，有一種遺傳型態自然科學家至今還不曾領略。它超越了所有科學家研究的範疇，讓他們只能高舉雙手投降，坦承自己無法解釋親眼目睹的一切。他們無法掌握這種神聖的遺傳現象。
20. It is the benignant force which decrees primal creation. It thrills down from the Divine, direct into every created being. It originates life, which the physical scientist has not done, nor ever can do. It stands out among all forces supreme, unapproachable. No human heredity can approach it. No human heredity measures up to it. 在創世之初，有一股正面能量昭告創造源起，它源自神聖的創世主，直達每一個被創造的生命。它創造了生命，這是自然科學家不曾也永遠無法企及的成就；它傲然屹立於所有至高力量中，遙不可及。沒有任何人類遺傳能與之比擬。
21. This Infinite Life flows through you; is you. Its doorways are but the faculties which comprise your consciousness. To keep open these doors is the Secret of Power. Is it not worth while to make the effort? 這股無限生命的力量在你的身體裡流動著，這股力量就是你。你的各種感官意識就是其出入口。你只要敞開大門就能掌握這股力量的奧祕。這難道不值得你花點力氣試試看嗎？
22. The great fact is, that the source of all life and all power is from within. Persons, circumstances and events may suggest need and opportunities, but the insight, strength and power to answer these needs will be found within. 「所有生命和力量都是源於內在世界。」這是一個偉大的事實。環境、人與事件也許可以為你提供需求與機會，但要回應這些需求所需的洞察力、能力與實力卻只存在於你的內在。
23. Avoid counterfeits. Build firm foundations for your consciousness upon forces which flow direct from the Infinite source, the Universal Mind of which you are the image and likeness. 你要謹慎明辨真假，並借由那股源自永恆源頭的力量，為你的意識打造堅固的基礎。那永恆力量的源頭就是宇宙心智，而你就是宇宙心智的形象與外觀。
24. Those we have come into possession of this inheritance are never quite the same again. They have come into possession of a sense of power hitherto undreamed of. They can never again be timid, weak, vacillating, or fearful. They are indissolubly connected with Omnipotence. Something in them has been aroused; they have suddenly discovered that they possess a tremendous latent ability of which they were heretofore entirely unconscious. 有幸繼承這份財產的人將因此煥然一新，脫胎換骨。他們掌握了至今從未想過的力量。他們不再怯懦、軟弱、猶豫、恐懼，還能進一步與萬能力量緊密連結。他們內心的感知被喚醒，突然發現自己其實早已擁有龐大潛能，但以前的自己竟然渾然不覺。
25. This power is from within, but we cannot receive it unless we give it. Use is the condition upon which we hold this inheritance. We are each of us but the channel through which the Omnipotent power is being differentiated into form; unless we give, the channel is obstructed and we can receive no more. This is true on every plane of existence and in every field of endeavor and all walks of life. The more we give, the more we get. The athlete who wishes to get strong must make use of the strength he has, and the more he gives the more he will get. The financier who wishes to make money must make use of the money he has, for only by using it can he get more.  這股力量由內而生，但我們必得先付出，才能獲得它。擁有繼承權的條件就是「使用」它。我們每個人都是萬能力量分化之後自我塑形的管道，除非我們付出力量，否則管道就會壅塞不通，我們也別想得到更多。這個道理在生活的各個層面、人生的各個階段，乃至各行各業全都適用。我們付出得越多，收穫也就越多。運動員若希望身體更強壯，就必須極盡所能地鍛鍊，只要投入越多，技巧就會越純熟；金融家若想財源廣進，就必須善於錢滾錢，唯有透過花錢，才能讓財源滾滾而來。
26. The merchant who does not keep his goods going out will soon have none coming in; the corporation which fails to give efficient service will soon lack customers; the attorney who fails to get results will soon lack clients, and so it goes everywhere; power is contingent upon a proper use of the power already in our possession; what is true in every field of endeavor, every experience in life, is true of the power from which every other power known among men is begotten -- spiritual power. Take away the spirit and what is left? Nothing. 商家如果無法持續賣出貨品，就不會有源源不絕的進帳；企業如果無法提供高效服務，就不會有顧客願意上門；律師如果無法打贏官司，就不會有客戶花錢聘用。這項道理放諸四海皆準。想要獲得力量，就要正確地運用我們既有的力量。這個在所有奮鬥領域、人生歷程適用的道理，也同樣適用於世間一切其他力量之源──精神的力量。如果把精神力量從人身上抽離，那還會剩下什麼？什麼都不剩。
27. If then the spirit is all there is, upon the recognition of this fact must depend the ability to demonstrate all power, whether physical, mental or spiritual. 如此，精神就是一切的源頭，要想展示所有力量的先決條件──無論是生理的、精神的或心靈的力量──就是對這個事實有所認知。
28. All possession is the result of the accumulative attitude of mind, or the money consciousness; this is the magic wand which will enable you to receive the idea, and it will formulate plans for you to execute, and you will find as much pleasure in the execution as in the satisfaction of attainment and achievement. 所有財富都是心智力量日積月累的結果，或者可以說是金錢意識運作的結果。這就是所謂點石成金的魔法棒，能讓你接收到好點子，也幫你擬定切實可行的計畫，而且還能讓你在執行計畫的過程中，獲得與達成目標時同等程度的幸福與喜悅。想要獲得力量，就要正確地運用我們既有的力量。

Make a complete mental picture of it, see the buildings, the grounds, the trees, friends, associations, everything complete. At first, you will find yourself thinking of everything under the sun, except the ideal upon which you desire to concentrate. But do not let that discourage you. Persistence will win, but persistence requires that you practice these exercises every day without fail. 現在，請進入你的小空間，坐在老位子上，保持和之前一樣的姿勢，然後在心中想像一個會讓你感到喜悅的舒適宜人之處。請描繪一幅完美的畫面，在心中清楚地看見那些建築大樓、大地、茂盛樹林、知己好友、親友熟人等。一開始你會發現，自己幾乎什麼雞毛蒜皮的小事都想到了，就是看不到自己真正想要聚精會神看到的場景。但千萬別灰心，只要堅持不懈天天練習，你終將能贏得最後的勝利。
