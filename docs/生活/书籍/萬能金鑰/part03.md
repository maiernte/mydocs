##### INTRODUCTION 

You have found that the Individual may act on the Universal, and that the result of this action and interaction is cause and effect. Thought, therefore, is the cause, and the experiences with which you meet in life are the effect. 你已經發現，個人有影響宇宙心智的能力，而這樣的交互作用所產生的結果有一種因果關係。思想就是因，你所遭遇的一切生活經歷就是果。

Eliminate, therefore, any possible tendency to complain of conditions as they have been, or as they are, because it rests with you to change them and make them what you would like them to be. 所以，請將你對過去或現今所有境遇的諸多抱怨一筆勾銷吧，因為能否改變這些狀況，並將它們形塑成你所希望的樣子，全都取決於你自己。

Direct your effort to a realization of the mental resources, always at your command, from which all real and lasting power comes. 請引導自己，致力去開發你的心靈所擁有的龐大精神能量，讓它永遠聽命於你，它將帶來真實、長久的力量。

Persist in this practice until you come to a realization of the fact that there can be no failure in the accomplishment of any proper object in life if you but understand your power and persist in your object, because the mind-forces are ever ready to lend themselves to a purposeful will, in the effort to crystalize thought and desire into actions, events and conditions. 持之以恆地練習，直到你完全領悟：如果你能充分理解自己的力量，並且堅定目標，你就可以實現人生的任何目標。這是因為心智力量隨時蓄勢待發，等著為堅定的意志提供援助，將你的想法和渴望轉化為明確具體的行動、事件和條件。

Whereas in the beginning of each function of life and each action is the result of conscious thought, the habitual actions become automatic and the thought that controls them passes into the realm of the subconscious; yet it is just as intelligent as before. It is necessary that it become automatic, or subconscious, in order that the self-conscious mind may attend to other things. The new actions will, however, in their turn, be come habitual, then automatic, then subconscious in order that the mind again may be freed from this detail and advanced to still other activities. When you realize this, you will have found a source of power which will enable you to take care of any situation in life which may develop. 雖然生命中的各個功能及行動都始於顯意識；習慣終將成自然，支配行動的思維會漸漸滲入潛意識的領域，但仍一如往常般地充滿智慧。讓思維逐漸自動化──即轉化成潛意識──是必要的，如此一來顯意識就可以轉而專注於處理其他事物。然而，一旦新的行動變成習慣，接著自動化，最後又轉為潛意識，顯意識就可以再度從這種細節中解放，進一步繼續投入其他的行動。當你真正領會這個道理，就能找到力量的泉源，它將助你遊刃有餘地處理生活中的一切狀況。

##### PART THREE

1. The necessary interaction of the conscious and subconscious mind requires a similar interaction between the corresponding systems of nerves. Judge Troward indicates the very beautiful method in which this interaction is effected. He says: "The cerebro-spinal system is the organ of the conscious mind and the sympathetic is the organ of the subconscious. The cerebro- spinal is the channel through which we receive conscious perception from the physical senses and exercise control over the movements of the body. This system of nerves has its centre in the brain." 顯意識和潛意識之間不可或缺的交互作用，需要神經系統促發相對應的反應。影響新思想運動甚深的英籍法官湯瑪士．綽華德（Thomas Troward）指出了讓這互動得以完成的美妙方式。他說：「**腦脊髓神經系統是顯意識的器官，交感神經系統則是潛意識發生的器官。**前者是我們透過感覺器官接收意識傳輸的管道，並有效掌控我們全身上下的所有動作，這套系統的中樞在大腦。」
2. The Sympathetic System has its centre in a ganglionic mass at the back of the stomach known as the Solar Plexus, and is the channel of that mental action which unconsciously supports the vital functions of the body. 交感神經系統自有一套位於神經節叢的中樞，確切的位置是在胃部後方，名為「**太陽神經叢**」，心智活動能在人無意識下維持身體的重要機能，就是透過太陽神經叢的運作。
3. The connection between the two systems is made by the vagus nerve which passes out of the cerebral region as a portion of the voluntary system to the thorax, sending out branches to the heart and lungs, and finally passing through the diaphragm, it loses its outer coating and becomes identified with the nerves of the Sympathetic System, so forming a connecting link between the two and making man physically a "single entity". 上述兩大系統由「迷走神經」相互連結。迷走神經自腦部對外延伸，延伸至胸腔，分支密布在心臟和肺臟，最終穿過橫膈膜，然後脫去表層組織，與交感神經合為一體，由此便構成兩大系統的互相串連，使個體成為一具生理上的「完整個體」。
4. We have seen that every thought is received by the brain, which is the organ of the conscious; it is here subjected to our power of reasoning. When the objective mind has been satisfied that the thought is true it is sent to the Solar Plexus, or the brain of the subjective mind, to be made into our flesh, to be brought forth into the world as reality. It is then no longer susceptible to any argument whatever. The subconscious mind cannot argue; it only acts. It accepts the conclusions of the objective mind as final. 我們已經知道，每一個想法都經由大腦接收。大腦是顯意識的器官，聽命於我們的推理能力。**當顯意識認定某個思想是正確的，此思想就會被傳送到太陽神經叢**──**即大腦的主觀心智**（潛意識）**，然後成為我們生命的一部分，接著這個思想會轉化為我們的血肉，並作為事實反映到現實生活。**至此，它再也不受任何推理論辯所動搖。潛意識無法據理推論提出反駁，只能據此行動，它會接受客觀心智（顯意識）做出的結論，並視為聖旨。
5. The Solar Plexus has been likened to the "sun of the body", because it is a central point of distribution for the energy which the body is constantly generating. This energy is very real energy, and this sun is a very real sun, and the energy is being distributed by very real nerves to all parts of the body, and is thrown off in an atmosphere which envelopes the body. 太陽神經叢被比喻成「人體的太陽」，因為人體會不斷產出能量，而它正是發散能量的中樞組織。這裡說的能量是貨真價實的能量，正如太陽是再真切不過的實體。這股能量透過神經系統被運送到身體的各個部位，然後散發出來，成為包覆身體的氣場。
6. If this radiation is sufficiently strong the person is called magnetic; he is said to be filled with personal magnetism. Such a person may wield an immense power for good. His presence alone will often bring comfort to the troubled minds with which he comes in contact. 倘若一個人散發出來的力量夠強大，他就會具備所謂的強烈磁吸力，成為大家經常掛在口中的萬人迷。這種人能對周遭人群散播正向能量，只要他一出現，往往就能為苦惱的人帶來莫大安慰，撫慰他們受傷的心靈。
7. When the Solar Plexus is in active operation and is radiating life, energy and vitality to every part of the body, and to every one whom he meets, the sensations are pleasant, the body is filled with health and all with whom he comes in contact experience a pleasant sensation. 當太陽神經叢處於活躍的狀態，對外四射生命力時，個人渾身上下的能量與活力就會處於蓄勢待發的狀態，等著傳給他接觸到的每個人；他會讓對方全身上下盈滿健康活力，與他接觸的每個人都會覺得既美好又愉悅。
8. If there is any interruption of this radiation the sensations are unpleasant, the flow of life and energy to some part of the body is stopped, and this is the cause of every ill to the human race, physical, mental or environmental. 倘若這種散發能量的過程受到干擾，感覺就會轉為厭惡不悅，流淌身體各個部位的生命和能量就此打住。這就是人類生理上、心理上或周遭環境失序的起因。
9. Physical because the sun of the body is no longer generating sufficient energy to vitalize some part of the body; mental because the conscious mind is dependent upon the subconscious mind for the vitality necessary to support its thought, and environmental, because the connection between the subconscious mind and the Universal mind, is being interrupted. 就生理層面來說，是因為身體再也無法對外傳遞充裕的能量來滋養身體的各個部位；就精神層面來說，是因為顯意識需要倚賴潛意識來提供能量以利思考；就環境層面來說，是因為連結潛意識與宇宙心智的橋梁突然中斷了。
10. The Solar Plexus is the point at which the part meets with the whole, where the finite becomes Infinite, where the Uncreate becomes create, the Universal becomes individualized, the Invisible becomes visible. It is the point at which life appears and there is no limit to the amount of life an individual may generate from this Solar centre. 太陽神經叢正是「部分」和「整體」的交匯點，在此，「有限」轉化為「無限」、「不存在」為轉化為「存在」、「宇宙」轉化為「個人」，「無形」轉化為「有形」；生命由此而生，人可以透過這個能量中心孕育無限的生命。
11. This centre of energy is Omnipotent because it is the point of contact with all life and all intelligence. It can therefore accomplish whatever it is directed to accomplish, and herein lies the power of the conscious mind; the subconscious can and will carry out such plans and ideas as may be suggested to it by the conscious mind. 這個能量中樞堪稱無所不能，因為它是所有生命力和智慧的匯合處。因此，依賴顯意識的力量，它可以完成一切你想要完成的任務，潛意識則可以執行顯意識指示的一切計畫和想法。

12. Conscious thought, then, is master of this sun centre from which the life and energy of the entire body flows and the quality of the thought which we entertain determines the quality of the thought which this sun will radiate, and the character of the thought which our conscious mind entertains will determine the character of the thought which this sun will radiate, and the nature of the thought which our conscious mind entertains will determine the nature of thought which this sun will radiate, and consequently will determine the nature of the experience which will result.  如此說來，有意識的思維就是太陽中樞的掌管者，而我們的生命力和能量都來自這個太陽中樞。我們抱持的思維品質、特性、本質，決定了這個中樞輻射出來的思維品質、特性、本質，最終結果便決定了人生的際遇。
13. It is evident, therefore, that all we have to do is let our light shine; the more energy we can radiate, the more rapidly shall we be enabled to transmute undesirable conditions into sources of pleasure and profit. The important question, then, is how to let this light shine; how to generate this energy. 因此，顯然地，我們必須做的事就是設法讓內心的光芒照拂各方，我們能夠對外輻射的能量越多，就能以越快的速度把討厭的狀態轉化為令人快樂、受益的泉源。但問題是，如何讓內心的光芒照拂各方？如何產生能量？
14. Non-resistant thought expands the Solar Plexus; resistant thought contracts it. Pleasant thought expands it; unpleasant thought contracts it. Thoughts of courage, power, confidence and hope all produce a corresponding state, but the one arch enemy of the Solar Plexus which must be absolutely destroyed before there is any possibility of letting any light shine is fear. This enemy must be completely destroyed; he must be eliminated; he must be expelled forever; he is the cloud which hides the sun; which causes a perpetual gloom. 開放的思維會擴展太陽神經叢，抗拒的思想則會壓抑它；愉悅的念頭會擴展它，不悅的念頭則會壓抑它。蘊含勇氣、力量、信心和希望的想法會產生相對應的狀態。恐懼是太陽神經叢最主要的敵人，我們必須徹底打倒這個強敵，才能讓太陽的光芒照拂各方。我們非得徹底打垮、殲滅、放逐這個敵人，因為它是遮蔽太陽光芒的烏雲，會給這個世界帶來黑暗。
15. It is this personal devil which makes men fear the past, the present and the future; fear themselves, their friends and their enemies; fear everything and everybody. When fear is effectually and completely destroyed, your light will shine, the clouds will disperse and you will have found the source of power, energy and life. 它是我們內心的惡魔，讓我們恐懼過去、現在與將來；恐懼自己、朋友與敵手；甚至恐懼每一件事、每一個人。當恐懼被徹底驅逐出境，烏雲消散過後，你的光芒自會顯露，你也就能找到力量、能量與生命的源頭。
16. When you find that you are really one with the Infinite power, and when you can consciously realize this power by a practical demonstration of your ability to overcome any adverse condition by the power of your thought, you will have nothing to fear; fear will have been destroyed and you will have come into possession of your birthright. 當你發現自己擁有無限力量，當你經由實際行動展現能力，明確意識到這股強大力量，並憑藉思考力量克服任何險阻障礙時，你將毫無所懼。恐懼將自動消失，而你將享有自己與生俱來的權利。
17. It is our attitude of mind toward life which determines the experiences with which we are to meet; if we expect nothing, we shall have nothing; if we demand much, we shall receive the greater portion. The world is harsh only as we fail to assert ourselves. The criticism of the world is bitter only to those who cannot compel room for their ideas. It is fear of this criticism that causes many ideas to fail to see the light of day. 正是我們對生命的態度決定我們生活中的各種境遇。要是我們無欲無求，就會毫無所獲；當我們渴望得越多，收穫就會越大。當我們不主動伸張自己的權利，世界就會變得苛刻嚴厲；當我們不為自己的思想爭取發揮空間，世界就會變得疾言厲色。正是因為害怕批評，我們的許多夢想都只能束之高閣，不見天日。
18. But the man who knows that he has a Solar Plexus will not fear criticism or anything else; he will be too busy radiating courage, confidence, and power; he will anticipate success by his mental attitude; he will pound barriers to pieces, and leap over the chasm of doubt and hesitation which fear places in his path. 但是，懂得太陽神經叢運作的人，將無懼任何負評，因為他忙著施展勇氣、信心和力量。他藉由心態擊倒所有障礙，跨過懷疑和猶豫的深淵──恐懼藏匿之處──成就自我並大獲成功。
19. A knowledge of our ability to consciously radiate health, strength and harmony will bring us into a realization that there is nothing to fear because we are in touch with Infinite Strength. **一旦我們體認到，自己擁有自動自覺對外界散發健康、力量與和諧的能耐，任何事都不足為懼，因為無限的力量時時與我們同在。**
20. This knowledge can be gained only by making practical application of this information. We learn by doing; through practice the athlete comes powerful. 唯有付諸實際應用這門知識，才能獲得這個體認。我們得邊做邊學，好比運動員必須天天練習才能變得更進步。
21. As the following statement is of considerable importance, I will put it in several ways, so that you cannot fail to get the full significance of it. If you are religiously inclined, I would say, you can let your light shine. If your mind has a bias toward physical science, I would say you can wake the Solar Plexus; or, if you prefer the strictly scientific interpretation, I will say that you can impress your subconscious mind. 由於接下來的論述至關重要，我將採取不同的方式說明，以免你錯誤理解它的意義。如果你信奉特定宗教，我必須說，你可以讓內心的光芒照拂各方；如果你偏好物理科學，我必須說，你可以喚醒體內的太陽神經叢；又或者如果你比較偏愛嚴格的科學闡釋，我必須說，你可以支配你的潛意識。

22. I have already told you what the result of this impression will be. It is the method in which you are now interested. You have already learned that the subconscious is intelligent and that it is creative, and responsive to the will of the conscious mind. What, then, is the most natural way of making the desired impression? Mentally concentrate on the object of your desire; when you are concentrating you are impressing the subconscious. 我已經明白告訴你，支配潛意識會有怎樣的結果，相信現在你感興趣的是方法。你已經知道，潛意識充滿智慧與創造力，它會對顯意識的意志有所回應。那麼，打造你渴望的效果最自然的方法是什麼？那就是，聚精會神在你渴望的目標上，當你全神貫注時，潛意識的力量就會發揮作用。
23. This is not the only way, but it is a simple and effective way, and the most direct way, and consequently the way in which the best results are secured. It is the method which is producing such extraordinary results that many think that miracles are being accomplished.這並非是唯一方法，卻是最簡單又有效且直接的方法，能夠讓你獲得最甜美的成果、最令人歎為觀止的成果，以至於許多人還以為奇蹟出現了。
24. It is the method by which every great inventor, every great financier, every great statesman has been enabled to convert the subtle and invisible force of desire, faith and confidence into actual, tangible, concrete facts in the objective world. 每一位成就卓越的發明家、金融家和政治家都採用了這個方法，將諸多微妙不可見的渴望、信心和信念的力量，轉化成客觀世界中實際、有形、具體的事實。
25. The subconscious mind is a part of the Universal mind. The Universal is the creative principle of the Universe, a part must be the same in kind and quality as the whole. This means that this creative power is absolutely unlimited; it is not bound by precedent of any kind, and consequently has no prior existing pattern by which to apply its constructive principle. 潛意識是宇宙心智的一部分，宇宙本身則是宇宙創造的原則，即使是部分，就型態與本質而言都與整體如出一轍。這意味著，創造性能量沒有限制，也不受任何先例束縛，因此，沒有既定範本需要遵守。
26. We have found that the subconscious mind is responsive to our conscious will, which means that the unlimited creative power of the Universal Mind is within control of the conscious mind of the individual. 我們已經知道，潛意識會回應我們的顯意識，這意味著個人的顯意識已掌控了宇宙心智的無限創造能量。
27. When making a practical application of this principle, in accordance with the exercises given in the subsequent lessons, it is well to remember that it is not necessary to outline the method by which the subconscious will produce the results you desire. The finite can not inform the Infinite. You are simply to say what you desire, not how you are to obtain it. 當你在後續的課程中實際應用這一法則時，請謹記，你不需要花費大把時間描述潛意識應該如何產生你渴望的結果。因為有限能力無法指導無限能力。你只需直白地陳述自己渴望的目標，而非你打算如何實現目標。
28. You are the channel by which the undifferentiated is being differentiated, and this differentiation is being accomplished by appropriation. It only requires recognition to set causes in motion which will bring about results in accordance with your desire, and this is accomplished because the Universal can act only through the individual, and the individual can act only through the Universal; they are one. 你是讓無差異化得以產生的管道，這種差異化是透過個體的召喚而得以實現。你只需要為想達到的成果設定相應的起因，就能根據自己的渴望產出相符合的成果。這份成果得以產生，是因為宇宙只能夠透過個人產生作用；反之，個人也只能借力宇宙實現。兩者原本就是一體。
29. For your exercise this week, I will ask you to go one step further. I want you to not only be perfectly still, and inhibit all thought as far as possible, but relax, let go, let the muscles take their normal condition; this will remove all pressure from the nerves, and eliminate that tension which so frequently produces physical exhaustion. 在本週的練習中，我會要求你更進一步，希望你不要只是讓身體靜止不動，盡全力阻隔所有的思緒，同要請你放鬆、完全放下，讓肌肉回到正常的狀態。這麼做可以除去神經系統的壓力，消弭那些導致肉體疲勞的緊張狀態。
30. Physical relaxation is a voluntary exercise of the will and the exercise will be found to be of great value, as it enables the blood to circulate freely to and from the brain and body. 身體放鬆是意志的練習，這種練習對你大有裨益，因為它能讓血液在大腦和身體間暢行無阻。
31. Tensions leads to mental unrest and abnormal mental activity of the mind; it produces worry, care, fear and anxiety. Relaxation is therefore an absolute necessity in order to allow the mental faculties to exercise the greatest freedom. 緊張會導致精神緊繃不安與心智反常；會引發憂慮、牽掛、恐懼和焦急。因此，如果希望心靈遊刃有餘地運作，放鬆絕對有其必要。

32. Make this exercise as thorough and complete as possible, mentally determine that you will relax every muscle and nerve, until you feel quiet and restful and at peace with yourself and the world. 進行這套練習時，務必盡可能地做到完整與徹底。在心理上放鬆每一塊肌肉和每一條神經，直到自己感受到平靜、平和，能和平地與自己及這個世界相處。
33. The Solar Plexus will then be ready to function and you will be surprised at the result. 此時，太陽神經叢就會接手運作，最終結果將讓你嘖嘖稱奇。
