###### INTRODUCTION 

Our difficulties are largely due to confused ideas and ignorance of our true interests. The great task is to discover the laws of nature to which we are to adjust ourselves. Clear thinking and moral insight are, therefore, of incalculable value. All processes, even those of thought, rest on solid foundations. 我們遭遇的困難多半源自想法紊亂、參不透自己真正的興趣何在。當務之急便是找出自然法則，好讓我們可以據此自我調整。清晰的思維及深入的洞察力具有無可估算的價值。包括思維在內的所有進程，全都立足在堅實基礎之上。

The keener the sensibilities, the more acute the judgment, the more delicate the taste, the more refined the moral feelings, the more subtle the intelligence, the loftier the aspiration--the purer and more intense are the gratifications which existence yields. Hence it is that the study of the best that has been thought in the world gives supreme pleasure. 我們的感官越敏銳、判斷越敏捷、品味越精緻、道德感越崇高、智識越縝密、志願越宏大，就會對現實生活產生越純粹、強烈的滿足感。而只要鑽研全世界最優秀的思想領域，就能獲得至高的歡愉。

The powers, uses and possibilities of the mind under the new interpretations are incomparably more wonderful that the most extravagant accomplishment, or even dreams of material progress. Thought is energy. Active thought is active energy; concentrated thought is a concentrated energy. Thought concentrated on a definite purpose becomes power. This is the power which is being used by those who do not believe in the virtue of poverty, or the beauty of self-denial. They perceive that this is the talk of weaklings. 經過重新的闡明，心智所具備的力量、效用與可能性將更加非同尋常，甚至連物質生活的夢想都因此而擁有更長足的進步。思想即能量。積極主動的思想即積極主動的能量，專注一致的思想即專注一致的能量。這就是力量，那些不想一輩子貧窮或自我否定的人就會懂得運用這股力量。「貧窮是美德」的想法跟自我否定，不過都只是弱者的藉口。

The ability to receive and manifest this power depends upon the ability to recognize the Infinite Energy ever dwelling in man, constantly creating and recreating his body and mind, and ready at any moment to manifest through him in any needful manner. In exact proportion to the recognition of this truth will be the manifestation in the outer life of the individual. 一個人能否接收、彰顯這股力量，端看個人是否能覺察到這股無窮的能量，它蘊藏在個人心中，時時創造、更新個人身、心、靈的狀態，隨時都準備好要透過個人充分發揮，轉化成他所需要的任何形態。個人對真理理解多少，他在外在世界就能獲得多少。

Part two explains the method by which this is accomplished. 本週將為你闡釋一整套完善的做法。

###### PART TWO

1. The operations of the mind are produced by two parallel modes of activity, the one conscious, and the other subconscious. Professor Davidson says: "He who thinks to illuminate the whole range of mental action by the light of his own consciousness is not unlike the one who should go about to illuminate the universe with a rushlight." 心智運作源於兩大平行的行為模式：顯意識和潛意識。加州大學柏克萊分校（University of California, Berkeley）哲學系教授唐納．戴維森（Donald Davidson）曾說：「想要透過自身的顯意識詮釋所有精神行動的人，就跟點燃一根蠟燭就想照亮全宇宙的人一樣。」
2. The subconscious' logical processes are carried on with a certainty and regularity which would be impossible if there existed the possibility of error. Our mind is so designed that it prepares for us the most important foundations of cognition, whilst we have not the slightest apprehension of the modus operandi. 潛意識的邏輯運作方式有其準確性與規則性，絕不可能有任何差錯。我們的心智堪稱精心設計的成果，早已為我們準備好最重要的認知基礎，但我們對它的運作模式卻毫無所悉。
3. The subconscious soul, like a benevolent stranger, works and makes provision for our benefit, pouring only the mature fruit into our lap; thus ultimate analysis of thought processes shows that the subconscious is the theatre of the most important mental phenomena. 靈魂的潛意識就好比懷抱善意的陌生人，默默勞動以滿足我們的所有需求；澆灌成熟的漿果餵養我們。經由對思考過程的終極分析，結果顯示：潛意識就是各種重要精神現象完美演出的劇場。
4. It is through the subconscious that Shakespeare must have perceived, without effort, great truths which are hidden from the conscious mind of the student; that Phidias fashioned marble and bronze; that Raphael painted Madonnas and Beethoven composed symphonies. 英國大文豪莎士比亞便是借由潛意識，才能不費吹灰之力參透最偉大的真理，古希臘時代最偉大雕塑家菲狄亞斯（Phidias）也是透過潛意識，才能將大理石和青銅雕刻成偉大的作品；義大利藝術家拉斐爾（Raphael）繪製《聖母像》（*Madonnas*）、德國音樂家貝多芬創作交響樂，也都是透過潛意識。
5. Ease and perfection depend entirely upon the degree in which we cease to depend upon the consciousness; playing the piano, skating, operating the typewriter, the skilled trades, depend for their perfect execution on the process of the sub-conscious mind. The marvel of playing a brilliant piece on the piano, while at the same time conducting a vigorous conversation, shows the greatness of our subconscious powers. 我們若想行事從容自在、盡善盡美，完全端視自己能否不再依靠顯意識行動；諸如彈鋼琴、溜冰、打字、熟練的交易行為等種種完美技巧，全都是潛意識運作的成果。當你看到一個人能夠一邊技巧高超地演奏華麗樂章，一邊還能引導活潑生動的對話，就能知道潛意識的功效有多令人歎為觀止。
6. We are all aware how dependent we are upon the subconscious, and the greater, the nobler, the more brilliant our thoughts are, the more it is obvious to ourselves that the origin lies beyond our ken. We find ourselves endowed with tact, instinct, sense of the beautiful in art, music, etc., or whose origin or dwelling place we are wholly unconscious. 我們都知道自己有多依賴潛意識，當我們的思想提升得越恢弘、高貴、卓越，就越能明確地體認到，潛意識的源頭遠在我們的認知範圍之外。我們會發現，造物主恩賜我們的機智、直覺、藝術、音樂等各方面的美感，全都蘊含在潛意識裡。
7. The value of the subconscious is enormous; it inspires us; it warns us; it furnishes us with names, facts and scenes from the storehouse of memory. It directs our thoughts, tastes, and accomplishes tasks so intricate that no conscious mind, even if it had the power, has the capacity for. 潛意識的價值無比巨大，它激勵我們、警惕我們；為我們記憶的儲藏室裝載各種姓氏名號、事實物件和場景；引導我們的思想、品味，也協助我們完成複雜任務。這些都是顯意識做不到的，這是即使擁有力量也無法達到的成就。
8. We can walk at will; we can raise the arm whenever we choose to do so; we can give our attention through eye or ear to any subject at pleasure. On the other hand, we cannot stop our heartbeats nor the circulation of the blood, nor the growth of stature, nor the formation of nerve and muscle tissue, nor the building of the bones, nor many other important vital processes. 我們可以依照自己的意願恣意漫步行走，只要我們想要就可以抬高手臂，也可以隨心所欲定睛關注、豎耳傾聽任何議題；但另一方面，我們無法停止心臟跳動、阻止血液循環，也不能壓抑身體成長，更做不到阻撓神經、肌肉組織形成、骨骼發育以及其他種種生理機能。
9. If we compare these two sets of action, the one decreed by the will of the moment, and the other proceeding in majestic, rhythmic course, subject to no vascillation, but constant at every moment, we stand in awe of the latter, and ask to have the mystery explained. We see at once that these are the vital processes of our physical life, and we cannot avoid the inference that these all-important functions are designedly withdrawn from the domain of our outward will with its variations and transitions, and placed under the direction of a permanent and dependable power within us. 倘若我們比較這兩組行為，前者是人的意念在當下發號行事，後者則是以崇高莊嚴且有規律的步調運作著；後者讓我們肅然起敬，油然而生一探奧祕的念頭。我們馬上就能體認到，後者是攸關生命的重要機能，因此我們可以自然地歸納出這個結論：所有攸關生命的重要身體功能，早在設計之初就已被隔離在我們的外在意志之外，自始至終僅受我們內在那股永恆、可靠的力量管理。
10. Of these two powers, the outward and changeable has been termed the "Conscious Mind," or the "Objective Mind" (dealing with outward objects). The interior power is called the "Subconscious Mind," or the "Subjective Mind," and besides its work on the mental plane it controls the regular functions which make physical life possible. 在這兩股力量中，外在、可變的力量稱為「顯意識」，或是「客觀心智」，主要工作是處理外在事物；內在力量則稱為「潛意識」，或是「主觀心智」，除了在精神層面發揮作用，也掌控肉體的生命功能，使其得以循序運作。
11. It is necessary to have a clear understanding of their respective functions on the mental plane, as well as of certain other basic principles. Perceiving and operating through the five physical senses, the conscious mind deals with the impressions and objects of the outward life. 我們必須清楚地理解前述兩股力量在心理層面上的個別功能，以及其特定的基本準則。顯意識透過五種生理感官的察覺與運作，處理外在的事物。
12. It has the faculty of discrimination, carrying with it the responsibility of choice. It has the power of reasoning--whether inductive, deductive, analytical or syllogistic--and this power may be developed to a high degree. It is the seat of the will with all the energies that flow therefrom. 它肩負明察秋毫、做出決定的責任，因此具有推論能力，包括歸納、推理、分析與三段式演繹。這股力量或許可以高度開發，因為它是意志與源於意志的所有能量的發源地。
13. Not only can it impress other minds, but it can direct the subconscious mind. In this way the conscious mind becomes the responsible ruler and guardian of the subconscious mind. It is this high function which can completely reverse conditions in your life. 顯意識不僅有能耐影響他人的心靈，同時還可以指揮潛意識。顯意識是潛意識的統治者與保護者，正是這項高難度的功能讓它可以徹底翻轉你的生活境況。
14. It is often true that conditions of fear, worry, poverty, disease, inharmony and evils of all kinds dominate us by reason of false suggestions accepted by the unguarded subconscious mind. All this the trained conscious mind can entirely prevent by its vigilant protective action. It may properly be called "the watchman at the gate" of the great subconscious domain. 人之所以被恐懼、焦慮、匱乏、疾病、不協調等各種「惡」支配，都是因為潛意識被錯誤的暗示影響，進而主宰我們的人生。其實，只要好好訓練顯意識，讓它隨時警醒保護潛意識，就能完全避免前述的不良狀況發生。我們可以將顯意識稱之為廣大潛意識國度的「守門員」。
15. One writer has expressed the chief distinction between the two phases of mind thus: "Conscious mind is reasoning will. Subconscious mind is instinctive desire, the result of past reasoning will." 曾有一名作家如此描述這兩種心智狀態的主要區別：「顯意識是推理的意志，潛意識則是本能的渴望，也是過往的推理意志所產出的結果。」 
16. The subconscious mind draws just and accurate inferences from premises furnished from outside sources. Where the premise is true, the subconscious mind reaches a faultless conclusion, but, where the premise or suggestion is an error, the whole structure falls. The subconscious mind does not engage in the process of proving. It relies upon the conscious mind, "the watchman at the gate," to guard it from mistaken impressions. 潛意識憑藉外界提供的先決條件做出合理的推理，只要先決條件無誤，潛意識便能歸納出精準正確的結論；反之，先決條件或暗示若有絲毫謬誤，整體架構便會功虧一簣。潛意識不會參與證明的過程，而是僅僅倚賴顯意識這名「守門員」為它阻隔錯誤印象。
17. Receiving any suggestions as true, the subconscious mind at once proceeds to act thereon in the whole domain of its tremendous field of work. The conscious mind can suggest either truth or error. If the latter, it is at the cost of wide-reaching peril to the whole being. 潛意識接收到任何暗示都會視為正確訊息，隨即據此在這片廣大的領地中展開處理程序。顯意識可以提供正確或錯誤的暗示，但要是給了錯誤暗示，最糟糕的代價就是使自己身陷險境。
18. The conscious mind ought to be on duty during every waking hour. When the "watchman" is "off guard," or when its calm judgment is suspended, under a variety of circumstances, then the subconscious mind is unguarded and left open to suggestion from all sources. During the wild excitement of panic, or during the height of anger, or the impulses of the irresponsible mob, or at any other time of unrestrained passion, the conditions are most dangerous. The sub- conscious mind is then open to the suggestion of fear, hatred, selfishness, greed, self- depreciation and other negative forces, derived from surrounding persons or circumstances. The result is usually unwholesome in the extreme, with effects that may endure to distress it for a long time. Hence, the great importance of guarding the subconscious mind from false impressions. 顯意識應該負起時時刻刻警醒的責任，一旦「守門員」擅離職守，或是你因為各種千奇百怪的狀況導致原本冷靜的判斷失了準頭，頓失防護的潛意識便會門戶洞開，任憑各種暗示長驅直入。當你處在極度驚慌、高度憤怒，或是受到不負責任的烏合之眾慫恿，或是陷入任何激情高漲的時刻，這些情況最是危險。潛意識會因此敞開大門，放任恐懼、憎恨、自私、貪婪、自憐自艾……等外部環境或周遭人士引發的負面情緒蜂擁而入。結果往往是走向極端不健康的下場，導致當事人深陷悲傷不可自拔。因此，保護潛意識免於遭受錯誤印象侵入至關重要。
19. The subconscious mind perceives by intuition. Hence, its processes are rapid. It does not wait for the slow methods of conscious reasoning. In fact, it can not employ them. 潛意識透過直覺感知一切。它的處理過程敏捷迅速，不像顯意識那般慢慢地進行推理。事實上，潛意識根本沒有推理能力。
20. The subconscious mind never sleeps, never rests, any more than does your heart, or your blood. It has been found that by plainly stating to the subconscious mind certain specific things to be accomplished, forces are set in operation that lead to the result desired. Here, then, is a source of power which places us in touch with Omnipotence. Here in is a deep principle which is well worth our most earnest study. **潛意識從不休眠、從不歇息，就和你、我的心跳或血流一樣。只要對它明白陳述必須完成的具體事項，就能使所有力量開始運作去達成你預期的結果。**因此，潛意識就是連結我們與偉大自然力量的能量，其運作的原理值得我們潛心去研究。
21. The operation of this law is interesting. Those who put it into operation find that when they go out to meet the person with whom they anticipate a difficult interview, something has been there before them and dissolved the supposed differences; everything is changed; all is harmonious; they find that when some difficult business problem presents itself they can afford to make delay and something suggests the proper solution; everything is properly arranged; in fact, those who have learned to trust the subconscious find that they have infinite resources at their Command. 這條法則的運作很有意思。假設某個人必須跟一個他原本預期很難溝通的對象見面，如果他懂得運用這條法則，他會驚喜地發現雙方竟然一見如故，事情出現了轉變，整個會面的過程既完滿又圓融。又假設某個人遭遇了事業經營上的困難，如果他懂得運用這條法則，他就可以協調將時程延後，進一步找出最適當的解決方案，每件事都能恰如其分地安排就緒。事實上，如果一個人能夠學會信任潛意識，就會發現自己可以任意支配無窮資源。
22. The subconscious mind is the seat of our principles and our aspirations. It is the fount of our artistic and altruistic ideals. These instincts can only be overthrown by an elaborate and gradual process of undermining the innate principles. 潛意識是我們的原則與渴望的所在之處，也是藝術鑑賞和利他主義這些美好理想的根源。只有經由惡意和故意的破壞，才能逐步改變潛意識中與生俱來的原則。
23. The subconscious mind can not argue controversially. Hence, if it has accepted wrong suggestions, the sure method of overcoming them is by the use of a strong counter suggestion, frequently repeated, which the mind must accept, thus eventually forming new and healthy habits of thought and life, for the subconscious mind is the seat of Habit. That which we do over and over becomes mechanical; it is no longer an act of judgment, but has worn its deep grooves in the subconscious mind. This is favorable for us if the habit be wholesome and right. If it be harmful, and wrong, the remedy is to recognize the omnipotence of the subconscious mind and suggest present actual freedom. The subconscious being creative and one with our divine source will at once create the freedom suggested. **潛意識沒有能力爭論是非對錯。因此，倘若它已經接受了錯誤暗示，打敗這些錯誤暗示的最好做法，就是灌輸自己強大的相反暗示，三不五時重複提醒，強迫心靈接受，最終就會形成全新、健康的思考方向與生活習慣，正因為潛意識心智是習慣的所在地。**當我們一而再、再而三地重複做某件事，就會逐漸成為機械反應，不再發揮判斷力，而是在潛意識建立深層的習慣。要是這項習慣既健康又正確，對我們而言再好不過；但如果它有毒害之虞而且錯得離譜，治本良方便是承認潛意識的無限能量，並暗示潛意識解除束縛。具有創造性的潛意識將立即解除我們所暗示的束縛。
24. To sum up: The normal functions of the subconscious on the physical side have to do with the regular and vital processes, with the preservation of life and the restoration of health; with the care of offspring, which includes an instinctive desire to preserve all life and improve conditions generally. 總而言之，就生理層面而言，潛意識的正常功能是維持生命的規律運轉，維繫生命、恢復健康並照料後代，包括保護一切生命、提升整體生存條件的本能。
25. On the mental side, it is the storehouse of memory; it harbors the wonderful thought messengers, who work, unhampered by time or space; it is the fountain of the practical initiative and constructive forces of life: It is the seat of habit. 就精神層面而言，它是記憶的倉庫，像港灣一樣庇護著偉大的思想信使，讓它們辛勤工作，不受時間和空間限制；它是生命中各種創新與建設力量的泉源；它也是習慣的所在地。
26. On the spiritual side, it is the source of ideals, of aspiration, of the imagination, and is the channel through which we recognize our Divine Source, and in proportion as we recognize this divinity do we come into an understanding of the source of power. 就心靈層面而言，它是理想、抱負和想像力的源頭，也是認識我們萬物之源的管道。當我們對這種神奇力量有所認識，就可以領悟到力量之源。
27. Some one may ask: "How can the subconscious change conditions?" The reply is, because the subconscious is a part of the Universal Mind and a part must be the same in kind and quality as the whole; the only difference is one of degree. The whole, as we know, is creative, in fact, it is the only creator there is, consequently, we find that mind is creative, and as thought is the only activity which the mind possesses thought must necessarily be creative also. 有些人可能會問：「潛意識究竟如何改變環境？」答案是：潛意識是宇宙心智的一部分，「部分」必定與「整體」擁有共通之處，只有程度的差異。正如我們所知，整體宇宙心智具有創造力，事實上，它是唯一造物主；結果我們也發現，思想是心智唯一的活動途徑，所以思想必定具備創造力。
28. But we shall find that there is a vast difference between simply thinking, and directing our thought consciously, systematically and constructively; when we do this we place our mind in harmony with the Universal Mind, we come in tune with the Infinite, we set in operation the mightiest force in existence, the creative power of the Universal Mind. This, as everything else, is governed by natural law, and this law is the "Law of attraction," which is that Mind is creative, and will automatically correlate with its object and bring it into manifestation. 但是，我們也發現，簡單地「想」和「有意識、系統化並正面積極地引導思維」兩者截然不同。當我們做到後者，便是將個人心智與宇宙心智協調一致、便是與無限同調、便是得以運用最強大的現有力量，即宇宙心智的創造力。和其他事物一樣，它也受到自然法則掌控，亦即「吸引力法則」，意指：心靈具有創造的能力，會自動地與目標連結，並引領它成真。

> 29. Last week I gave you an exercise for the purpose of securing control of the physical body; if you have accomplished this you are ready to advance. This time you will begin to control your thought. Always take the same room, the same chair, and the same position, if possible. In some cases it is not convenient to take the same room, in this case simply make the best use of such conditions as may be available. Now be perfectly still as before, but inhibit all thought; this will give you control over all thoughts of care, worry and fear, and will enable you to entertain only the kind of thoughts you desire. Continue this exercise until you gain complete mastery. 上星期我們進行了掌控身體的練習，假若你已經可以自如地掌控身體，就可以邁入下一個階段。這一回你要開始掌控自己的思想。可能的話，請務必在同一個空間練習，最好是同一張椅子、同一個位置。若有時實在無法選擇同一個空間，那就視情況而定，善用既有的條件即可。現在，請像前一次那樣進入完美的靜止狀態，務必清空所有思緒，這樣才有助你控制並排除一切擔憂、恐懼和焦慮的念頭，還能讓你懷抱那些自己真正渴望的想法。請持續練習，直到完全精熟掌握技巧為止。


30. You will not be able to do this for more that a few moments at a time, but the exercise is valuable, because it will be a very practical demonstration of the great number of thoughts which are constantly trying to gain access to your mental world. 剛開始這個練習可能無法持續很久，但這個練習極其有價值，因為它確實能夠證明，究竟有多少念頭總是動不動就想要闖進你的精神世界。
31. Next week you will receive instructions for an exercise which may be a little more interesting, but it is necessary that you master this one first. 在下週的課程中，你會收到一套更有趣的訓練，在此之前，請務必先掌握本週課程的訓練。

"*Cause and effect is as absolute and undeviating in the hidden realm of thought as in the world of visible and material things. Mind is the master weaver, both of the interior garment of character and the outer garment of circumstance.*" -- James Allen

> 「在無法觸及的思維層面，因果法則都絕對且必然發生，如同在可見的物質世界一樣。心靈是個偉大的裁縫，無論在編織內心還是外部環境的華衣。」—— 詹姆士•艾伦
