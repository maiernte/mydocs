###### INTRODUCTION

Experiments with parasites found on plants indicate that even the lowest order of life is enabled to take advantage of natural law. This experiment was made by Jacques Loch, M.D., Ph. D., a member of the Rockefeller Institute. 賈克．洛克（Jacques Loch）博士是專注生醫領域研究的洛克菲勒學院（Rockefeller Institute；譯註：1965年改名Rockefeller University）成員，他曾經拿植物做實驗，結果顯示，即使是最低等的生命也會運用自然法則。

"In order to obtain the material, potted rose bushes are brought into a room and placed in front of a closed window. If the plants are allowed to dry out, the aphids (parasites), previously wingless, change to winged insects. After the metamorphosis, the animals leave the plants, fly to the window and then creep upward on the glass." 「我們為了要取得實驗素材，就把玫瑰盆栽帶進室內，置放在一扇緊閉的窗前。如果任由這株植物枯萎，原本寄生在植物身上的無翼蚜蟲就會長出翅膀，變成有翼的昆蟲。等牠們的外形蛻變完成，這些動物就會離開植物，飛向窗口，然後沿著玻璃往上爬。」

It is evident that these tiny insects found that the plants on which they had been thriving were dead, and that they could therefore secure nothing more to eat and drink from this source. The only method by which they could save themselves from starvation was to grow temporary wings and fly, which they did. 顯然，這些小昆蟲也發現賴以維生的植物宿主已經枯死，因此也無法再從中獲得任何食物來源。牠們唯一免淪飢餓的自救之道就是長出一對臨時急用的翅膀，三十六計飛走為上策。牠們也的確這麼做了。

Experiments such as these indicate that Omniscience as well as Omnipotence is omnipresent and that the tiniest living thing can take advantage of it in an emergency. 這類實驗顯示，全知、全能的力量無所不在，即使是最卑微的生命也會在緊要當頭發揮這股力量。

Part Fifteen will tell you more about the law under which we live. It will explain that these laws operate to our advantage; that all conditions and experiences that come to us are for our benefit; that we gain strength in proportion to the effort expended, and that our happiness is best attained through a conscious cooperation with natural laws. 第十五週的課程將告訴你更多我們賴以生存的法則，除了解釋這些法則運作對我們有益，也會詳述，所有我們走過的經歷與景況都是為了成就自我，並闡明種豆得豆、種瓜得瓜的道理，最後則是開示我們，只要能自發自覺地與自然法則合作無間，最幸福、最快樂的日子就唾手可得。

###### PART FIFTEEN

1. The laws under which we live are designed solely for our advantage. These laws are immutable and we cannot escape from their operation. 我們依循各種法則生活，它們都是為了讓我們得到益處設計而成。這些法則恆久不變，而且任何人都無法置身它們之外生活。
2. All the great eternal forces act in solemn silence, but it is in our power to place ourselves in harmony with them and thus express a life of comparative peace and happiness. 所有偉大永恆的力量都是在莊嚴肅靜中悄然運作，但我們也可以發揮自身的力量讓自己與它和諧一致，如此一來便可彰顯出相對平和、快樂的人生。
3. Difficulties, inharmonies, and obstacles, indicate that we are either refusing to give out what we no longer need, or refusing to accept what we require. 種種困難、不和睦與障礙都指向一個原因：我們拒絕付出自己不再需要的物品，或拒絕接受自己需要的物品。
4. Growth is attained through an exchange of the old for the new, of the good for the better; it is a conditional or reciprocal action, for each of us is a complete thought entity and this completeness makes it possible for us to receive only as we give. 成長是汰舊換新、精益求精的過程；也可說是一種有條件或互惠的行為，因為我們每個人都是一個完整的思想實體，這份完整性讓我們「先給出去才能得到」。
5. We cannot obtain what we lack if we tenaciously cling to what we have. We are able to consciously control our conditions as we come to sense the purpose of what we attract, and are able to extract from each experience only what we require for our further growth. Our ability to do this determines the degree of harmony or happiness we attain. 如果我們冥頑不靈地緊緊握住現有的事物，就不可能張手拿取我們欠缺的事物。當我們開始明白被自己吸引來的一切事物的真正意義，也才能從每一次的經歷中擷取進一步成長所需要的養分。這兩點能做到什麼程度，決定了我們實現和諧幸福的程度。
6. The ability to appropriate what we require for our growth, continually increases as we reach higher planes and broader visions, and the greater our abilities to know what we require, the more certain we shall be to discern its presence, to attract it and to absorb it. Nothing may reach us except what is necessary for our growth. 隨著我們自身境界的提升、視野逐步拓展，我們獲取成長所需養分的能力也會持續上升。我們體認自身需求的能力越強大，就越能明白分辨一切所需何在、越能吸引與吸收這些事物。如此一來，我們身邊的一切都是我們成長所需的養分。
7. All conditions and experiences that come to us do so for our benefit. Difficulties and obstacles will continue to come until we absorb their wisdom and gather from them the essentials of further growth. 我們遭逢的所有境遇與經歷，都是為了使我們獲益。除非我們能在困難與障礙中記取教訓，汲取其中的智慧，並轉化為未來成長所需的養分，否則困難與障礙將不斷出現。
8. That we reap what we sow is mathematically exact. We gain permanent strength exactly to the extent of the effort required to overcome difficulties. 古諺「種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆」確實一語中的。我們付出多少努力戰勝困難，就能從中獲取多強大的永恆力量。
9. The inexorable requirements of growth demand that we exert the greatest degree of attraction for what is perfectly in accord with us. Our highest happiness will be best attained through our understanding of, and conscious cooperation with natural laws. 為了能不斷成長，我們必須發揮最大的吸引力，吸引所有與我們狀態一致的事物向自身靠攏。唯有當我們能完全領悟並全心與自然法則合作，才能爭取到最大程度的幸福。
10. In order to possess vitality thought must be impregnated with love. Love is a product of the emotions. It is therefore essential that the emotions be controlled and guided by the intellect and reason. 我們必須置身充滿愛的環境，才能發想出生氣勃勃的思維。愛是情感的產物，因此人必須透過智慧與理性來掌控並引導情感。
11. It is love which imparts vitality to thought and thus enables it to germinate. The law of attraction, or the law of love, for they are one and the same, will bring to it the necessary material for its growth and maturity. 愛才能賦予思想生命力，並因此讓它得以萌芽茁壯。吸引力法則就是愛的法則，兩者合體為一，將可以供應必要元素，催生並催熟我們的思想。
12. The first form which thought will find is language, or words; this determines the importance of words; they are the first manifestation of thought -- the vessels in which thought is carried. They take hold of the ether and by setting it in motion reproduce the thought to others in the form of sound. 愛才能賦予思想生命力，並因此讓它得以萌芽茁壯。吸引力法則就是愛的法則，兩者合體為一，將可以供應必要元素，催生並催熟我們的思想。
13. Thought may lead to action of any kind, but whatever the action, it is simply the thought attempting to express itself in visible form. It is evident, therefore, that if we wish desirable conditions, we can afford to entertain only desirable thoughts. 思想可以引導各種行動，但無論是何種行動，都只是思想運用一種清楚可見的形式自我呈現而已。因此顯而易見的是，如果我們盼望得到滿意的狀態，就應當先抱持渴望的想法。
14. This leads to the inevitable conclusion that if we wish to express abundance in our lives, we can afford to think abundance only, and as words are only thoughts taking form, we must be especially careful to use nothing but constructive and harmonious language, which when finally crystallized into objective forms, will prove to our advantage. 這便導出一個無可迴避的結論：倘若我們盼望生活富裕充足，就只能想著富裕充足。由於文字是思想的外顯形式，我們應該格外小心謹慎，除了將具有建設性的和諧話語掛在嘴上，其餘一概不提，因為終有一天這些話語會一一成真，屆時將帶來好處多多。
15. We cannot escape from the pictures we incessantly photograph on the mind, and this photography of erroneous conceptions is exactly what is being done by the use of words, when we use any form of language which is not identified with our welfare. 我們無法逃避自己的心智持續描述的各種畫面，就是因為我們說出了不利自身福祉的話語，不當的語言就會產生錯誤觀念的影像。
16. We manifest more and more life as our thought becomes clarified and takes higher planes. This is obtained with greater facility as we use word pictures that are clearly defined, and relieved of the conceptions attached to them on lower planes of thought. 隨著我們的思想變得清明澄澈、水準提升，也就越能豐富地彰顯生命。如果我們能善用定義清楚的詞語，就能剔除過往低階思想所得出的概念，並更容易展現生命力。
17. It is with words that we must express our thoughts, and if we are to make use of higher forms of truth, we may use only such material as has been carefully and intelligently selected with this purpose in view. 我們必須訴諸語言文字來表達自身想法，如果我們打算運用更高層次的真理，那麼我們就要依據這個擇定的目標，審慎、明智地選擇用字遣詞。
18. This wonderful power of clothing thoughts in the form of words is what differentiates man from the rest of the animal kingdom; by the use of the written word he has been enabled to look back over the centuries and see the stirring scenes by which he has come into his present inheritance.  善用語言文字表現思維的神奇力量，正是區分人與動物的重要分水嶺。我們得以藉由各種書面文字回首歷史，回首那些動人心弦的場景，進而瞭解自己如何得到今日這一切。
19. He has been enabled to come into communion with the greatest writers and thinkers of all time, and the combined record which we possess today is therefore the expression of Universal Thought as it has been seeking to take form in the mind of Man. 我們藉由書面文字，才得以和歷來最偉大的作家、思想家神交，當今我們所擁有的的綜合紀錄，正是宇宙思想的展現。
20. We know that the Universal Thought has for its goal the creation of form, and we know that the individual thought is likewise forever attempting to express itself in form, and we know that the word is a thought form, and a sentence is a combination of thought forms, therefore, if we wish our ideal to be beautiful or strong, we must see that the words out of which this temple will eventually be created are exact, that they are put together carefully, because accuracy in building words and sentences is the highest form of architecture in civilization and is a passport to success. 我們知道，宇宙思想有創造有形實體的目標，而人類思想也一樣想要讓自身具體化，而語言文字就是一種思維形式，一個句子就是思維形式的組合體。由此可知，**如果我們期盼自己的理想臻於美好、強大，就必須懂得精煉自身的文字語言、三思而後言。因為遣詞用字講究精準正是一切文明最崇高的建築形式，也是成功的通行證。**
21. Words are thoughts and are therefore an invisible and invincible power which will finally objectify themselves in the form they are given. 文字語言就是思維，也是一種隱不可見、攻無不克的力量，而且同樣會依其樣貌，在有形世界中化為實體。
22. Words may become mental places that will live forever, or they may become shacks which the first breeze will carry away. They may delight the eye as well as the ear; they may contain all knowledge; in them we find the history of the past as well as the hope of the future; they are living messengers from which every human and superhuman activity is born. 文字語言可以昇華成為永遠存在的精神殿堂，或者也可以淪為禁不起微風吹拂的破爛陋室；它們可以悅人耳目、包羅一切知識；我們可以從中鑑古知來；它們就像是活力充沛的信使，每一種人類和超人類活動都源自於此。
23. The beauty of the word consists in the beauty of the thought; the power of the word consists in the power of the thought, and the power of the thought consists in its vitality. How shall we identify a vital thought? What are its distinguishing characteristics? It must have principle. How shall we identify principle? 文字語言的精微之處便在於思想之美；文字語言的力量來自思想的力量，而思想的力量則來自其生命力。我們如何清楚明辨什麼思維具有活力呢？它具有什麼獨樹一格的特徵嗎？其間必定有原則可循，但我們要怎樣才能一窺堂奧？
24. There is a principle of Mathematics, but none of error; there is a principle of health, but none of disease; there is a principle of truth, but none of dishonesty; there is a principle of light, but none of darkness, and there is a principle of abundance, but none of poverty. 數學計算有其定理，但錯誤無跡可循；追求健康有門道，但疾病上門沒有章法；真理原則明確，歪理卻毫無規則；光線有運作法則，黑暗則任意妄為；富足有道，貧窮無度。
25. How shall we know that this is true? Because if we apply the principle of Mathematics correctly we shall be certain of our results. Where there is health there will be no disease. If we know the Truth we cannot be deceived by error. If we let in light there can be no darkness, and where there is abundance there can be no poverty. 我們該如何知道上述說法是否為真？因為，倘若我們正確應用數學定理，就可以確定計算結果；健康存在之處，就不會有疾病；如果我們認識真理，就不會被歪理蒙蔽；要是我們迎接光明，就不會置身黑暗；有富裕在的地方就沒有貧窮。
26. These are self-evident facts, but the all-important truth that a thought containing principle is vital and therefore contains life and consequently takes root, and eventually but surely and certainly displaces the negative thoughts, which by their very nature can contain no vitality, is one which seems to have been overlooked. 這些都是不證自明的事實，但我們經常忽略一個再真實不過的真理──凡是符合宇宙原理的思想都充滿生命力，因此它得以扎根、成長，最終也必然取代負面的想法，因為負面想法的本質不具備任何生命力。
27. But this is a fact which will enable you to destroy every manner of discord, lack and limitation.  這個真理可以幫助你打破一切混亂、匱乏、局限。
28. There can be no question but that he who "is wise enough to understand" will readily recognize that the creative power of thought places an invincible weapon in his hands and makes him a master of destiny. 毫無疑問，擁有「足夠智慧明瞭一切」的人將很快就會體認到，思想的創造力就像他們手上所向披靡的武器，使他們成為自己命運的主宰。
29. In the physical world there is a law of compensation which is that "the appearance of a given amount of energy anywhere means the disappearance of the same amount somewhere else," and so we find that we can get only what we give; if we pledge ourselves to a certain action we must be prepared to assume the responsibility for the development of that action. The subconscious cannot reason. It takes us at our word; we have asked for something; we are now to receive it; we have made our bed, we are now to lie in it; the die has been cast; the threads will carry out the pattern we have made. 物理世界中有一道永恆定律，即是「在任何地方新生多少能量，就代表另一個地方消減多少能量」，由此可知，我們只能得到與自己付出相對應的等值回報。倘使我們誓言投身一場行動，就必須做好一旦行動上路就開始承擔各項責任的準備。潛意識不會推理，只會聽命行事；我們要求某樣事物就會得到這樣事物；我們鋪好了床自然就會和枕而眠；骰子既已擲出就不能收回；我們畫了藍圖，就會順著一筆一畫逐步完工。
30. For this reason Insight must be exercised so that the thought which we entertain contains no mental, moral or physical germ which we do not wish objectified in our lives. 為此，**我們應該磨練自己的洞察力，好讓自己所抱持的思維不受心靈、道德或是生理上的病毒染指。**
31. Insight is a faculty of the mind whereby we are enabled to examine facts and conditions at long range, a kind of human telescope; it enables us to understand the difficulties, as well as the possibilities, in any undertaking. 洞察力是一種心靈能力，讓我們可以站在宏觀的角度檢視事實與條件；它是專屬人類的望遠鏡，讓我們不管投身什麼行動都能看清困難，也看到機會。
32. Insight enables us to be prepared for the obstacles which we shall meet; we can therefore overcome them before they have any opportunity of causing difficulty. 洞察力讓我們為早一步預見的障礙做好準備，因此我們可以在它們還沒化為攔路虎之前就早一步攻克敵人。
33. Insight enables us to plan to advantage and turn our thought and attention in the right direction, instead of into channels which can yield no possible return. 洞察力讓我們得以依據自身的優勢做好計畫，並將我們的思想、注意力轉向正確方向，不會浪費在沒有任何回饋的事上卻不自知。
34. Insight is therefore absolutely essential for the development of any great achievement, but with it we may enter, explore and possess any mental field. 因此，對一切偉大崇高的成就而言，洞察力肯定是不可或缺的能力；一旦我們擁有這個能力，就可以長驅直入、探索並支配任何心靈領域。
35. Insight is a product of the world within and is developed in the Silence, by concentration. 洞察力是內心世界的產物，在平靜中，透過專注就能養成。
> 36. For your exercise this week, concentrate on Insight; take your accustomed position and focus the thought on the fact that to have a knowledge of the creative power of thought does not mean to possess the art of thinking. Let the thought dwell on the fact that knowledge does not apply itself. That our actions are not governed by knowledge, but by custom, precedent and habit. That the only way we can get ourselves to apply knowledge is by a determined conscious effort. Call to mind the fact that knowledge unused passes from the mind, that the value of the information is in the application of the principle; continue this line of thought until you gain sufficient insight to formulate a definite program for applying this principle to your own particular problem. 本週，你的功課就是專注培養「洞察力」。請依照慣例坐在老位置上，集中思緒思考這項事實：「認識思想的創造力並不代表掌握思維的藝術。」全神貫注地思考這些事實：「知識無法應用其本身」「我們的行動並非接受知識指揮，而是受積習、流俗和先例所掌控」「我們唯有立下堅定的決心，才能讓自己去應用所得到的知識」。請喚起你對「用不到的知識就無法留在心智」「資訊的價值在於妥善的應用」這些事實的記憶；持續順著這個思維方向，直到你得到充分的洞察力，足以架構出一套明確的計畫，將這個原則應用在你的特定問題上。


"Think truly, and thy thoughts
Shall the world's famine feed;
Speak truly, and each word of thine
Shall be a fruitful seed;
Live truly, and thy life shall be
A great and noble creed."

—— Horatio Bonar

"To every man there openeth a way,
And the high soul climbs the high way,
And the low soul gropes the low;
And in between on the misty flats, The rest drift to and fro.
But to every man there openeth A high way and a low
And every man decideth
The way his soul shall go."
