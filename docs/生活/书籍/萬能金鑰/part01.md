##### INTRODUCTION 

It is my privilege to enclose herewith Part One of The Master Key System. Would you bring into your life more power, get the power consciousness, more health, get the health consciousness, more happiness, get the happiness consciousness. Live the spirit of these things until they become yours by right. It will then become impossible to keep them from you. The things of the world are fluid to a power within man by which he rules them. 在下有幸得以隨函附上《萬能金鑰》的第一週課程。你想要為自己的人生增添更多力量嗎？請建立權力意識；想更健康？請建立健康意識；想更幸福？請建立幸福意識。請領悟這些事情的精髓，直到它們終有一天成為你不可分割的一部分，如此一來，它們就再也不可能從你手中被奪走。在這個世界上，萬事萬物都會流向能夠掌控它們的人手上。

You need not acquire this power. You already have it. But you want to understand it; you want to use it; you want to control it; you want to impregnate yourself with it, so that you can go forward and carry the world before you. 你無需費事爭取這股力量，因為你早已擁有它。但是你應該深入瞭解、活用並掌控它；應該讓它自然而然地融入體內，成為自身的一部分，這樣一來，你就能夠勇往直前，一舉大獲成功。

Day by day as you go on and on, as you gain momentum, as your inspiration deepens, as your plans crystallize, as you gain understanding, you will come to realize that this world is no dead pile of stones and timber, but that it is a living thing! It is made up of the beating hearts of humanity. It is a thing of life and beauty. 日子一天天過去，當你一路前行、蓄積動能、靈感噴發、計畫日益清晰、感悟與日俱增，這時你將明白，我們生存的世界絕非單由死氣沉沉的岩石、草木構成，它是活生生的存在！其組成要素便是強而有力的人類心智，充滿活力與美感。

It is evident that it requires understanding to work with material of this description, but those who come into this understanding, are inspired by a new light, a new force, they gain confidence and greater power each day, they realize their hopes and their dreams come true, life has a deeper, fuller, clearer meaning than before. 你若想獲得前述的力量，就必須理解箇中內涵。真正領悟到的人會被一道嶄新的光芒、一種全新的力量啟發，每一天都獲得更強大的力量與自信，得以成就願望、實現夢想；人生也就擁有比以往更深刻、清楚的意義。

And, now, Part One.... 現在，就讓我們進入第一週的課程。

#####  PART ONE

1. That much gathers more is true on every plane of existence and that loss leads to greater loss is equally true. 「富者恆富」、「貧者恆貧」的道理一直存在於現實生活中的各個層面。
2. Mind is creative, and conditions, environment and all experiences in life are the result of our habitual or predominant mental attitude. 心智具有創造性。外在客觀條件、周遭環境與一切人生經歷，都是心態日積月累的結果。
3. The attitude of mind necessarily depends upon what we think. Therefore, the secret of all power, all achievement and all possession depends upon our method of thinking. **我們的心態取決於我們的思想運作，因此，一切權力、成就與財富也都取決於我們的思考方式。**
4. This is true because we must "be" before we can "do," and we can "do" only to the extent which we "are," and what we "are" depends upon what we "think." 我們必須先成為「某種類型的人才」，才能「創造某種成就」；而且我們「創造的成就」受限於我們「本能所及的範圍」；而我們「本能所及的範圍」則取決於我們「思考的內容」。
5. We cannot express powers that we do not possess. The only way by which we may secure possession of power is to become conscious of power, and we can never become conscious of power until we learn that all power is from within. 我們無法展現自己根本不具備的力量。想要保有力量的所有權，唯一方法就是清楚地意識到力量的存在；除非我們明白所有力量都是發自內心，否則我們根本無法清楚地意識到力量的存在。
6. There is a world within – a world of thought and feeling and power; of light and life and beauty and, although invisible, its forces are mighty. 內在世界確實存在，那是個盈滿思想、情感與力量的世界；是充滿光明、生命力與美感的世界；雖然肉眼不可見，力量卻強大無比。
7. The world within is governed by mind. When we discover this world we shall find the solution for every problem, the cause for every effect; and since the world within is subject to our control, all laws of power and possession are also within our control.   內在世界的統治者就是我們的心智。一旦我們探索心靈世界，就能找到每一個問題的解決之策、每一個結果的肇因；當內在世界聽從我們的掌控，一切力量與財富法則也將掌握在我們手中。
8. The world without is a reflection of the world within. What appears without is what has been found within. In the world within may be found infinite Wisdom, infinite Power, infinite Supply of all that is necessary, waiting for unfoldment, development and expression. If we recognize these potentialities in the world within they will take form in the world without. 外在世界是內在世界的投射，也就是所謂的「境隨心轉」、「相由心生」。內在世界擁有無窮的智慧、力量與供給，正等著被開發與釋放。倘若我們體認到內在世界的各種潛能，就可以將它們展現於外在世界。
9. Harmony in the world within will be reflected in the world without by harmonious conditions, agreeable surroundings, the best of everything. It is the foundation of health and a necessary essential to all greatness, all power, all attainment, all achievement and all success. 當內在世界處於圓滿與完融，外在世界就會映射出和諧的狀態、舒適宜人的環境、美好的事物。它是健康的基礎，也是所有偉大、力量、功績、成就和勝利的必要條件。
10. Harmony in the world within means the ability to control our thoughts, and to determine for ourselves how any experience is to affect us. **內在世界的圓滿完融代表我們擁有控制思想的能力，得以自主決定任何經歷將對我們產生何種影響。**
11. Harmony in the world within results in optimism and affluence; affluence within results in affluence without. 內在世界的協調帶來樂觀和豐足；內在的豐足則進一步帶來外在的富足。
12. The world without reflects the circumstances and the conditions of the consciousness within. 外在世界反映了內在意識的境況。
13. If we find wisdom in the world within, we shall have the understanding to discern the marvelous possibilities that are latent in this world within, and we shall be given the power to make these possibilities manifest in the world without.如果我們探求內在世界找到智慧，就能領悟如何明辨潛藏在內在世界的潛能，並因此獲得力量在外在世界發揮這些潛能。
14. As we become conscious of the wisdom in the world within, we mentally take possession of this wisdom, and by taking mental possession we come into actual possession of the power and wisdom necessary to bring into manifestation the essentials necessary for our most complete and harmonious development. 一旦我們體認到內在世界蘊藏的智慧，精神層面就能擁有這種智慧；因為我們擁有這筆精神財富，便能進一步實際擁有力量和智慧，讓我們發展到最完整、最協調的境界。
15. The world within is the practical world in which the men and women of power generate courage, hope, enthusiasm, confidence, trust and faith, by which they are given the fine intelligence to see the vision and the practical skill to make the vision real. 我們的內在世界是一處講求實際的世界。在這裡，擁有這股力量的人會油然而生勇氣、希望、熱情、信心、信賴與信念。他們善用這些上天賜予的非凡才智，因而得以清楚看見願景，也獲得化夢想為現實的實際技能。
16. Life is an unfoldment, not accretion. What comes to us in the world without is what we already possess in the world within. **生命並非從無到有的過程，而是循序展開的過程。我們從外在世界獲得的東西，其實都是我們的內心世界早已擁有的東西。**
17. All possession is based on consciousness. All gain is the result of an accumulative consciousness. All loss is the result of a scattering consciousness. 一切的所有權都立足於認知的基礎上。所有收穫都是認知累積的成果；所有損失則是缺乏認知的結果。
18. Mental efficiency is contingent upon harmony; discord means confusion; therefore, he who would acquire power must be in harmony with Natural Law. 心智的發揮取決於你的內在是否完滿和諧，而雜亂不和諧則代表亂無章法。所有獲得力量的人必然都與自然法則和睦共處。
19. We are related to the world without by the objective mind. The brain is the organ of this mind and the cerebro-spinal system of nerves puts us in conscious communication with every part of the body. This system of nerves responds to every sensation of light, heat, odor, sound and taste. 客觀心智（Objective Mind，又稱「顯意識」）將我們自身與外在世界相連，大腦就是客觀心智的器官，腦脊髓神經系統則讓我們有意識地與全身上下各個部位互相連結。這套神經系統會對光線、熱度、氣味、聲音與滋味等各種感官知覺發生反應。
20. When this mind thinks correctly, when it understands the truth, when the thoughts sent through the cerebro-spinal nervous system to the body are constructive, these sensations are pleasant, harmonious. 當我們的心智正確思考、當我們的心智領悟真理、當腦脊髓神經系統傳送到全身每一處的意念都是正確指令，所有感官都會發出愉悅、和諧的訊號。
21. The result is that we build strength, vitality and all constructive forces into our body, but it is through this same objective mind that all distress, sickness, lack, limitation and every form of discord and inharmony is admitted to our lives. It is therefore through the objective mind, by wrong thinking, that we are related to all destructive forces. 結果是：我們可以讓力量、活力以及一切有建設性的能量挹注體內。然而，這個客觀存在的心智同時也為我們的生活帶來悲傷、疾病、匱乏、限制，以及各種不和諧與衝突。當我們在錯誤思考的情況下，客觀心智也會讓我們與破壞性的力量連結。
22. We are related to the world within by the subconscious mind. The solar plexus is the organ of this mind; the sympathetic system of nerves presides over all subjective sensations, such as joy, fear, love, emotion, respiration, imagination and all other subconscious phenomena. It is through the subconscious that we are connected with the Universal Mind and brought into relation with the Infinite constructive forces of the Universe. 我們透過潛意識與內在世界連結：太陽神經叢（Solar Plexus）是潛意識的主要器官；交感神經系統掌控各種主觀感覺，包括快樂、恐懼、愛意、情感、渴望、想像以及所有潛意識現象。潛意識為我們與「宇宙心智」（Universal Mine）搭起橋梁，並串聯廣袤宇宙所蘊含的無限正向力量。
23. It is the coordination of these two centers of our being, and the understanding of their functions, which is the great secret of life. With this knowledge we can bring the objective and subjective minds into conscious cooperation and thus coordinate the finite and the infinite. Our future is entirely within our own control. It is not at the mercy of any capricious or uncertain external power. 生命的偉大之祕即源於前述兩大中心的溝通協調，充分理解這兩大中心各別的運作功能，就等於掌握了生命的奧祕。具備這個認知後，我們方能引領客觀與主觀心智（潛意識）展開協作，並由此調和統整有限與無限世界。未來完全在我們的自主掌握中，無須聽命變化無常、不確定的外部力量擺布。
24. All agree that there is but one Principle or Consciousness pervading the entire Universe, occupying all space, and being essentially the same in kind at every point of its presence. It is all powerful, all wisdom and always present. All thoughts and things are within Itself. It is all in all.  浩瀚宇宙中唯有一個「法則」或「意識」廣布其中，盈滿太空，無論存在於什麼空間，其本質都不會改變，它全能、全知、無所不在，涵蓋了所有思維與事物。它是一切的根本。
25. There is but one consciousness in the universe able to think; and when it thinks, its thoughts become objective things to it. As this Consciousness is omnipresent, it must be present within every individual; each individual must be a manifestation of that Omnipotent, Omniscient and Omnipresent Consciousness. 宇宙中唯有一種意識有能力思考；當它思考時，它的思維就會轉化為客觀的事物。這種意識無所不在，存在於每一個體的內在。每個人都是這無所不能、無所不知、無所不在的意識形諸於外的展現。
26. As there is only one Consciousness in the Universe that is able to think it necessarily follows that your consciousness is identical with the Universal Consciousness, or, in other words, all mind is one mind. There is no dodging this conclusion. 由於宇宙中僅有一個意識有能力思考，所以你的意識必然與宇宙意識毫無二致。換句話說，所有心智如出一轍。
27. The consciousness that focuses in your brain cells is the same consciousness which focuses in the brain cells of every other individual. Each individual is but the individualization of the Universal, the Cosmic Mind. 聚攏在你腦細胞中的意識與聚攏在其他人腦細胞中的意識一模一樣。每個人不過是宇宙或宇宙心智個體化之後的結果。
28. The Universal Mind is static or potential energy; it simply is; it can manifest only through the individual, and the individual can manifest only through the Universal. They are one. 宇宙心智是靜態的，是一種潛在的能量；唯有透過人才能得以展現，而人也唯有透過宇宙方能自我彰顯。兩者實為一體。
29. The ability of the individual to think is his ability to act on the Universal and bring it into manifestation. Human consciousness consists only in the ability of man to think. Mind in itself is believed to be a subtle form of static energy, from which arises the activities called 'thought, ' which is the dynamic phase of mind. Mind is static energy, thought is dynamic energy -the two phases of the same thing. Thought is therefore the vibratory force formed by converting static mind into dynamic mind. 人所擁有的「思考」能力能夠影響宇宙心智，使其在有形世界中彰顯。人類的意識只存在於有能力思考的人身上。因此我們可以相信，心智本身是一種靜態能量的微妙形式，由此產生的活動稱之為「思考」（thought），思考就是心智的動態階段。的內在。所以，當個人思考時，思維就會順著其特質具體化，自然轉化成有形世界客觀的事實或狀態。心智是靜態能量，思考則是動態能量──它們可說是一體的兩面。思考是靜態心智轉化為動態心智時產生的振動力量。
30. As the sum of all attributes are contained in the Universal Mind, which is Omnipotent, Omniscient and Omnipresent, these attributes must be present at all times in their potential form in every individual. Therefore, when the individual thinks, the thought is compelled by its nature to embody itself in an objectivity or condition which will correspond with its origin. 無所不能、無所不知、無所不在的宇宙心智總合了一切特質，因此這些特質也潛藏於每一個體的內在。所以，當個人思考時，思維就會順著其特質具體化，自然轉化成有形世界客觀的事實或狀態。
31. Every thought therefore is a cause and every condition an effect; for this reason it is absolutely essential that you control your thoughts so as to bring forth only desirable conditions. 由此可知，**每一個思維皆是起因，每一種境遇皆為後果；只要你能掌握自己的思考，就能夠達到你想要的狀態。** 這一點絕對至關重要。
32. All power is from within, and is absolutely under your control; it comes through exact knowledge and by the voluntary exercises of exact principles. 所有力量皆發自內心，而且百分之百任由個人掌控；這股力量源於正確的知識，也源於你主動地實踐所發現的法則。
33. It should be plain that when you acquire a thorough understanding of this law, and are able to control your thought processes, you can apply it to any condition; in other words, you will have come into conscious cooperation with Omnipotent law which is the fundamental basis of all things. 一旦你融會貫通這套法則，就能支配你的思考，將其應用在各種情況中。換句話說，你能夠有意識地運用萬事萬物的基本準則，即無所不能的宇宙法則。
34. The Universal Mind is the life principle of every atom which is in existence; every atom is continually striving to manifest more life; all are intelligent, and all are seeking to carry out the purpose for which they were created. 宇宙心智是存在於每一顆原子的生命法則；每一顆原子不斷地盡力展現無窮的生機；每顆原子都具有智慧，都在探尋自己誕生於世的目的，並設法實現目的。
35. A majority of mankind lives in the world without; few have found the world within, and yet it is the world within that makes the world without; it is therefore creative and everything which you find in your world without has been created by you in the world within. 多數人都活在外在世界，僅有極少數人發掘內在世界，而內在世界正是造就外在世界的推手。內在世界深具創造力，你在外在世界所發現的萬事萬物皆由內在世界所創造。
36. This system will bring you into a realization of power which will be yours when you understand this relation between the world without and the world within. The world within is the cause, the world without the effect; to change the effect you must change the cause. 一旦你充分理解內在與外在世界之間的關連，這套系統將會引領你進一步體悟你自身內蘊的力量。**內心世界可謂因，外在世界則謂果，你若想改變後果，就得從起因下手。**
37. You will at once see that this is a radically new and different idea; most men try to change effects by working with effects. They fail to see that this is simply changing one form of distress for another. To remove discord, we must remove the cause, and this cause can be found only in the world within. 你馬上就會發現，這是一個幾近全新、截然不同的概念。多數人都是有標治標，試圖用結果來改變結果，卻沒發現這只是將原有的苦惱轉變成另一種型態的苦惱而已。我們若想移除不和諧的狀態，就應該斬草除根，除掉存在於我們內在世界中的成因。
38. All growth is from within. This is evident in all nature. Every plant, every animal, every human is a living testimony to this great law, and the error of the ages is in looking for strength or power from without. 萬物成長都是源自內在世界，舉世皆然。每一株植物、每一隻動物、每一個人類都是這偉大法則活生生的見證，想要從外在世界尋求力量或權力，是最大的錯誤。
39. The world within is the Universal fountain of supply, and the world without is the outlet to the stream. Our ability to receive depends upon our recognition of this Universal Fountain, this Infinite Energy of which each individual is an outlet, and so is one with every other individual. 內在世界是宇宙所有供給的泉源，外在世界則是水流的出水口。我們能接收到多少力量，取決於對宇宙泉源的認知有多少，因為每個人都是無限能量的出水口。
40. Recognition is a mental process, mental action is therefore the interaction of the individual upon the Universal Mind, and as the Universal Mind is the intelligence which pervades all space and animates all living things, this mental action and reaction is the law of causation, but the principle of causation does not obtain in the individual but in the Universal Mind. It is not an objective faculty but a subjective process, and the results are seen in an infinite variety of conditions and experiences. 「認知」是一種心智活動，人的心智活動便是個體與宇宙心智之間交互作用的結果。宇宙心智充滿智慧，充斥在所有空間，賦予所有生命體勃勃活力，這種精神行動的交互作用遵循了因果法則。這套法則並非源於個人，而是源自宇宙心智；它不是客觀的能力，而是主觀的進程；我們可以在諸多無窮變化的境遇及體驗中找到無數的例子來證明因果關係的存在。
41. In order to express life there must be mind; nothing can exist without mind. Everything which exists is some manifestation of this one basic substance from which and by which all things have been created and are continually being recreated. 我們若想展現生命，就必須先養成心智。若無心智，則萬事不成。萬事萬物的存在都是它的體現，萬物由此創造而成，也由此繼續創造再生。
42. We live in a fathomless sea of plastic mind substance. This substance is ever alive and active. It is sensitive to the highest degree. It takes form according to the mental demand. Thought forms the mold or matrix from which the substance expresses. 我們活在廣袤不可預測的宇宙，它充滿了具可塑性的心靈物質，這種物質永遠生氣勃勃。它具有高度敏感性，能根據心智的需求自我塑形，而讓此物質塑造成型的模具就是我們的思維。
43. Remember that it is in the application alone that the value consists, and that a practical understanding of this law will substitute abundance for poverty, wisdom for ignorance, harmony for discord and freedom for tyranny, and certainly there can be no greater blessing than these from a material and social standpoint. 請謹記，「實際應用」是讓它產生最大價值的方法。如果你能理解這條法則，就能以富足取代貧困、以智慧取代無知、化混亂為和諧，化暴政為自由。就物質與社會的角度而言，無疑沒有比這種改變更美好的恩賜了。思維是啟動宇宙法則的萬能金鑰。

> 44. **Now make the application**: Select a room where you can be alone and undisturbed; sit erect, comfortably, but do not lounge; let your thoughts roam where they will but be perfectly still for from fifteen minutes to half an hour; continue this for three or four days or for a week until you secure full control of your physical being. 現在，讓我們實際起而行動吧！擇定一處可以獨處、不受打擾的空間。落坐時請挺直腰桿，姿態輕鬆，但不要隨便懶散；任由思緒漫遊直達完美靜止境地，讓你的身體維持在完全靜止的狀態15～30分鐘。連續練習三、四天或甚至一整個星期，直到你可以完全掌控自己的身體狀態為止。

45. Many will find this extremely difficult; others will conquer with ease, but it is absolutely essential to secure complete control of the body before you are ready to progress. Next week you will receive instructions for the next step; in the meantime you must have mastered this one. 許多人會覺得這個過程簡直難如登天，也有人覺得易如反掌，你得先完全掌控自己的身體，才能準備好向前進步，這一點至關重要。下星期你將會收到邁向下一步的指導方針，在這段等待時間，你必須做到熟練以上的練習。
