###### NTRODUCTION - PART NINE

In this Part you may learn to fashion the tools by which you may build for yourself any condition you desire. 在本週，你將學會製作一套工具，用以創造一切自身的渴望。

If you wish to change conditions you must change yourself. Your whims, your wishes, your fancies, your ambitions may be thwarted at every step, but your inmost thoughts will find expression just as certainly as the plant springs from the seed. 如果你有意改造環境，第一步就是改變自己。在你突發奇想、心生期盼，欲將雄心壯志付諸行動的過程中可能步步受挫，但內心深處的思想必定會展現在有形的世界中，一如植物的種籽萌芽發葉一般自然。

Suppose, then, we desire to change conditions, how are we to bring this about? The reply is simple: By the law of growth. Cause and effect are as absolute and undeviating in the hidden realm of thought as in the world of material things. 若此，假設我們有意改造環境，該如何著手？回答很簡單：依循成長法則行事即可。不論是在思想這個隱藏的國度還是在現實的物質世界，因果關係都絕對適用，絕對不會有一絲一毫的偏差。

Hold in mind the condition desired; affirm it as an already existing fact. This indicates the value of a powerful affirmation. By constant repetition it becomes a part of ourselves. We are actually changing ourselves; are making ourselves what we want to be. 在心中常存你所渴望的境遇，彷彿這境遇已然實現那般，肯定地說出你希望的狀況，堅定不移地信守它。這就是堅定信念的價值。透過一再的重複，它會融入我們，成為自身的一部分。實際上，我們就是在改變自己，把自己改造成夢寐以求的樣子。

Character is not a thing of chance, but it is the result of continued effort. If you are timid, vacillating, self-conscious, or if you are over-anxious or harassed by thoughts of fear or impending danger, remember that is axiomatic that "two things cannot exist in the same place at the same time." Exactly the same thing is true in the mental and spiritual world; so that your remedy is plainly to substitute thoughts of courage, power, self-reliance and confidence, for those of fear, lack and limitation. 性格不是一朝一夕的產物，而是長期努力的結果。倘若你屬於懦弱膽怯、優柔寡斷、怕生害羞的類型，或是你一想到即將到來的危險便會產生恐懼，因而過度焦慮、煩躁不安，請謹記以下這個不言自明的真理：「兩種不同事物不能在同一時間、同一地點共存。」從精神和心靈世界來看，這一點也無庸置疑。所以，要醫治上述毛病的藥方非常簡單，只要服下勇氣、能力、自強、自信的念頭這帖解藥，就能取代無助、畏怯、匱乏、有限的想法。

The easiest and most natural way to do this is to select an affirmation which seems to fit your particular case. The positive thought will destroy the negative as certainly as light destroys darkness, and the results will be just as effectual. 你若想辦到這一點，最簡單、自然的做法就是：挑選一句最能符合你的特別情況的肯定句。積極正面的想法必將摧毀消極負面的念頭，就如同白晝驅散黑夜一樣確定，結果必將完全奏效。

Act is the blossom of thought, and conditions are the result of action, so that you constantly have in your possession the tools by which you will certainly and inevitably make or unmake yourself, and joy or suffering will be the reward. 行動是思想所綻放的鮮花，境遇則是行動的結果。這麼看來，你一直握有某種必不可少的工具，它們要不是成就你就是毀滅你；你所得到的回饋若非歡樂就是苦痛。

###### PART NINE

1. There are only three things which can possibly be desired in the "world without" and each of them can be found in the "world within." The secret of finding them is simply to apply the proper "mechanism" of attachment to the omnipotent power to which each individual has access. 「外在世界」中只有三樣事物值得期待，而且每一樣都可以在「內在世界」找到。找到它們的祕訣很簡單，只要找到一種能與宇宙全能力量連結的「機制」，而且我們每個人都能與這股力量相通。
2. The three things which all mankind desires and which are necessary for his highest expression and complete development are Health, Wealth and Love. All will admit that Health is absolutely essential; no one can be happy if the physical body is in pain. All will not so readily admit that Wealth is necessary, but all must admit that a sufficient supply at least is necessary, and what would be considered sufficient for one, would be considered absolute and painful lack for another; and as Nature provides not only enough but abundantly, wastefully, lavishly, we realize that any lack or limitation is only the limitation which has been made by an artificial method of distribution.  所有人共同渴望的三件事分別是「愛」、「健康」與「財富」，這可說是人類發展到最高層次、最全面的境界。相信所有人都承認，「健康」絕對至關重要，畢竟纏綿病榻的人怎麼可能滿心歡喜。至於「財富」這部分，也許不是每個人都會毫不遲疑地承認財富不可或缺，但所有人肯定都同意，夠用至少是必要條件。只不過，對甲而言夠用的程度，對乙來說可能是絕對無法忍受的大缺口。如果我們去觀察自然界，就會發現大自然不僅僅是供應所需，而且其供給量源源不絕，甚至到了浪費奢侈的地步。由此可知，一切的匱乏或局限都只不過是人為的分配方法有缺陷而造成的。
3. All will probably admit that Love is the third, or maybe some will say the first essential necessary to the happiness of mankind; at any rate, those who possess all three, Health, Wealth, and Love, find nothing else which can be added to their cup of happiness. 我們所有人可能都會坦承，「愛」是第三件重要大事，或者可能有人會說，對於人類幸福來說，愛是頭等重要的大事。無論如何，「健康」、「財富」與「愛」三者皆有的人心中將滿溢幸福，再也沒有空間容納第四件大事。
4. We have found that the Universal substance is "All Health," "All Substance" and "All Love" and that the mechanism of attachment whereby we can consciously connect with this Infinite supply is in our method of thinking. To think correctly is therefore to enter into the "Secret Place of the Most High." 我們已經知道，宇宙的本質等同於「所有健康」、「所有財富」和「所有愛」，我們可以用來與無限連結的機制就是我們的思維方式。因此，正確思考就會帶領你進入「偉人的祕密聖殿」。
5. What shall we think? If we know this we shall have found the proper mechanism of attachment which will relate us to "Whatsoever things we desire." This mechanism may seem very simple when I give it to you, but read on; you will find that it is in reality the "Master-Key," the "Alladin's lamp," if you please; you will find that it is the foundation, the imperative condition, the absolute law of well-doing, which means, well-being. 那我們應該思考些什麼？如果我們知道這個問題的答案，就能找到與「我們渴想的一切事物」連結的機制。當我揭露這套機制的祕訣後，乍看之下你可能會覺得非常簡單，一旦深究就會發現，它實際上就是「萬能金鑰」，或者也可以隨你高興稱為「阿拉丁神燈」。你還會發現，它就是一切善行福祉的基礎、必要條件和絕對法則。
6. To think correctly, accurately, we must know the "Truth." The truth then is the underlying principle in every business or social relation. It is a condition precedent to every right action. To know the truth, to be sure, to be confident, affords a satisfaction beside which no other is at all comparable; it is the only solid ground in a world of doubt, conflict and danger. 我們只要思考正確、精準，就一定能明瞭所謂的「真理」。真理是奠定所有事業和社會關係的基礎法則，人必須先瞭解真理，然後才能做出正確的行為。認識真理、獲得肯定、贏來自信，就能獲得真正的滿足，這是一切其他事物無法相提並論的成就。在充斥懷疑、衝突和危險的世界中，它是唯一堅實的穩固基地。
7. To know the Truth is to be in harmony with the Infinite and Omnipotent power. To know the truth is, therefore, to connect yourself with a power which is irresistible and which will sweep
away every kind of discord, inharmony, doubt or error of any kind, because the "Truth is mighty and will prevail." 認識真理就是與無限、全能力量和諧相處。因此，你若想認識真理，就得想辦法讓自己與無窮的全能力量連結，它有能耐掃除各式各樣的喧鬧與不和、懷疑與謬誤，因為「真理無所不能，戰勝一切。」
8. The humblest intellect can readily foretell the result of any action when he knows that it is based on truth, but the mightiest intellect, the most profound and penetrating mind loses its way hopelessly and can form no conception of the results which may ensue when his hopes are based on a premise which he knows to be false. 即使是一個欠缺智慧的人，只要他所採取的行動基於真理，就能準確預言其後果；反之，就算是天資最聰穎的人，即使他再學識淵博、明察秋毫，一旦他的希望建立在錯誤的前提之上，最終也會迷失方向，完全無法預測可能產生什麼後果。
9. Every action which is not in harmony with Truth, whether through ignorance or design, will result in discord, and eventual loss in proportion to its extent and character. **所有無法與真理同步協調的行動，無論是刻意為之或者無心插柳，都會帶來喧鬧不協調，終將招致損失，其程度多寡取決於這項行動的程度和特性。**
10. How then are we to know the truth in order to attach this mechanism which will relate us to the Infinite? 若此，我們應該如何認識真理，以便接上與無限連結的機制？
11. We can make no mistake about this if we realize that truth is the vital principle of the Universal Mind and is Omnipresent. For instance, if you require health, a realization of the fact that the "I" in you is spiritual and that all spirit is one; that wherever a part is the whole must be, will bring about a condition of health, because every cell in the body must manifest the truth as you see it. If you see sickness; they will manifest sickness; if you see perfection they must manifest perfection. The affirmation, "I am whole, perfect, strong, powerful, loving, harmonious and happy”, will bring about harmonious conditions. The reason for this is because the affirmation is in strict accordance with the Truth, and when truth appears every form of error or discord must necessarily disappear. 倘若我們能體悟，「真理」就是「宇宙心智」至關重要的原則，而且無所不在，就能夠接上那個機制。舉例來說，你想要身體健康，你只需體認一個事實：內在的「我」具有精神屬性，所有的精神又都合而為一，部分即整體。這個認知將為你帶來健康的體魄，因為你體內每一顆細胞都會展現出你所認識的真理。假使你觸目所及盡是疾病，細胞就會彰顯疾病；但如果你看到完美體況，它們也就展現出完美的體況。**你若肯定自我地說：「我是完整、完美、強健、有力、熱情、和諧又快樂的人！」那麼你就會獲得和諧的境遇。**這是因為，這句話與真理密切一致，當真理現身，一切謬誤和混亂便因此消失。
12. You have found that the "I" is spiritual, it must necessarily then always be no less than perfect, the affirmation. "I am whole, perfect, strong, powerful, loving, harmonious and happy" is therefore an exact scientific statement. 你已經知道，「我」具有精神屬性，必然是絕對完美，因此，「我是完整、完美、強健、有力、熱情、和諧又快樂的人」這個主張絕對是符合科學邏輯的論述。
13. Thought is a spiritual activity and spirit is creative, therefore the result of holding this thought in mind, must necessarily bring about conditions in harmony with the thought. 思想是一種心靈活動，心靈具有創造性，將這一點銘記在心，現實的境況就會與你的思想保持和諧一致。
14. If you require Wealth a realization of the fact that the "I" in you is one with the Universal mind which is all substance, and is Omnipotent, will assist you in bringing into operation the law of attraction which will bring you into vibration with those forces which make for success and bring about conditions of power and affluence in direct proportion with the character and purpose of your affirmation. 倘若你要求財富，只要體認到，內在的「我」即是宇宙心智一部分，它又是全部的財富，而且無所不在，這個認識便能協助你實現、發揮吸引力法則，讓你能夠與敦促你邁向成功的力量產生共鳴，並為你帶來與你宣稱的目標絕對一致的能力與財富。
15. Visualization is the mechanism of the attachment which you require. Visualization is a very different process from seeing; seeing is physical, and is therefore related to the objective world, the "world without," but Visualization is a product of the imagination, and is therefore a product of the subjective mind, the "world within." It therefore possesses vitality; it will grow. The thing visualized will manifest itself in form. The mechanism is perfect; it was created by the Master Architect who "doeth all things well," but unfortunately sometimes the operator is inexperienced or inefficient, but practice and determination will overcome this defect. 「視覺化想像」就是你所需要的機制。「視覺化想像」和肉眼的「看」是完全截然不同的兩個過程。肉眼的「看」是生理行為，因此與客觀世界，亦即「外在世界」相關；但是「視覺化想像」是想像力的產物，因此也就是主觀世界，亦即「內在世界」的產物。因此，「視覺化想像」的產物便擁有生命力，得以使自身化為有形世界的實體。這套機制完美無瑕，是由全能偉大的造物主所創。但遺憾的是，操作這機制的人往往是生手或能力不足。不過所謂熟能生巧，只要勤加練習、下定決心，必能克服這個弱點。
16. If you require Love try to realize that the only way to get love is by giving it, that the more you give the more you will get, and the only way in which you can give it, is to fill yourself with it, until you become a magnet. The method was explained in another lesson. 假設你渴求愛，就請試著去理解：得到愛的唯一方式是付出愛。你給得越多，得到也就越多；而付出的唯一方式就是先讓它盈滿心中，直到自己成為一顆愛的磁石。獲得愛的手法將在其他週的課程詳加闡述。
17. He who has learned to bring the greatest spiritual truths into touch with the so-called lesser things of life has discovered the secret of the solution of his problem. One is always quickened, made more thoughtful, by his nearness of approach to great ideas, great events, great natural objects, and great men. Lincoln is said to have begotten in all who came near him the feeling awakened when one approaches a mountain, and this sense asserts itself most keenly when one comes to realize that he has laid hold upon things that are eternal, the power of Truth. 如果有人已經學會把最偉大的精神真理與生命中的細微末節連結起來，就等於是找到解決所有問題的祕密。一個人越接近偉大的理念、偉大的事業、偉大的自然實物、偉大的人物，就越會受到啟發鼓舞，思想也就越發深刻。據說，每一位曾經接觸美國前總統亞伯拉罕．林肯（Abraham Lincoln）的人都會不由自主地產生一股仰之彌高、望之彌堅的崇敬感。尤其是，當他們意識到自己正肩負著永恆真理的重責大任時，這種感覺更是分外強烈。
18. It is sometimes an inspiration to hear from someone who has actually put these principles to the test, someone who has demonstrated them in their own life. A letter from Frederick Andrews offers the following insight: 有時候，聽到有人正在實踐或檢測這些原則，或聆聽在自己的生活中付諸實現的人現身說法，你會得到不同的啟發和激勵。以下是已故美國密蘇里州基督教團結學校部長佛德列克．艾利亞斯．安德魯斯（Frederick Elias Andrews）在一封信中提出的真知灼見：
19. I was about thirteen years old when Dr. T. W. Marsee, since passed over, said to my mother: "There is no possible chance, Mrs. Andrews. I lost my little boy the same way, after doing everything for him that it was possible to do. I have made a special study of these cases, and I know there is no possible chance for him to get well." 當時我大約十三歲，無意中聽到如今已故的T．W．馬希（T. W. Marsee）醫師曾對家母說：「安德魯斯太太，在下萬分抱歉，令郎毫無治癒可能。我自己的兒子也是因為同樣的病因過世。我嘗試過一切可能的方法，但終究藥石罔效、無能為力。我特別研究過這類疾病，因此知道令郎沒有機會可以痊癒。」
20. She turned to him and said: "Doctor, what would you do if he were your boy?" and he answered, "I would fight, fight, as long as there is a breath of life to fight for." 家母反問他：「醫師，倘使他是您的孩子，您會怎樣做？」對方回答：「我會奮鬥下去、絕不認輸。只要他一息尚存，我就要和疾病搏鬥下去。」
21. That was the beginning of a long drawn-out battle, with many ups and downs, the doctors all agreeing that there was no chance for a cure, though they encouraged and cheered us the best they could. 就這樣一場曠日費時的消耗戰開始了，期間我的病勢多次起伏，所有醫師都認為沒有治癒的希望，但他們還是善盡一己之力，不斷鼓勵、安慰我們。
22. But at last the victory came, and I have grown from a little, crooked, twisted, cripple, going about on my hands and knees, to a strong, straight, well formed man. 然而，最終我們戰勝疾病。我也從一名弱小、萎縮、畸形、跛腳，而且只能手腳並用在地上爬行的孩子，茁壯成為強壯、挺拔、健康的男子漢。
23. Now, I know you want the formula, and I will give it to you as briefly and quickly as I can. 我知道你一定很想知道我使用的祕方，我將盡可能簡單明瞭地告訴你。
24. I built up an affirmation for myself, taking the qualities I most needed, and affirming for myself over and over again, "I am whole, perfect, strong, powerful, loving, harmonious and happy." I kept up this affirmation, always the same, never varying, till I could wake up in the night and find myself repeating, "I am whole, perfect, strong, powerful, loving, harmonious and happy." It was the last thing on my lips at night and the first thing in the morning. 我為自己設計了一句自我肯定句子，其中蘊含了我最需要的各種特質能力，然後我一遍又一遍地對自己說：「我是完整、完美、強健、有力、熱情、和諧又快樂的人。」我一直緊守著這個信念，絕不改變立場、絕不反覆，直到有一晚我從夢中醒來，聽見自己喃喃自語：「我是完整、完美、強健、有力、熱情、和諧又快樂的人。」這就是我每天清晨醒來所說的第一句話，也是每晚入睡前所說的最後一句話。
25. Not only did I affirm it for myself, but for others that I knew needed it. I want to emphasize this point. Whatever you desire for yourself, affirm it for others, and it will help you both. We reap what we sow. If we send out thoughts of love and health, they return to us like bread cast upon the waters; but if we send out thoughts of fear, worry, jealousy, anger, hate, etc., we will reap the results in our own lives. 我不僅對自己說這句話，也分享給在我看來每一位需要這句話的人。我想要強調一點──無論你渴望什麼目標，請當著他人面前斬釘截鐵地宣布它，你們雙方都會因此受益。我們種下什麼因，就會收穫什麼果。假設我們廣散愛與健康的想法，它們也會反過來回報我們；但要是我們拋出恐懼、憂愁、嫉妒、憤怒、憎恨等想法，也肯定會在生活中親嚐同樣的惡果。
26. It used to be said that man is completely built over every seven years, but some scientists now declare that we build ourselves over entirely every eleven months; so we are really only eleven months old. If we build the defects back into our bodies year after year, we have no one to blame but ourselves. 據說，人每隔七年就會煥然一新，但最近有一些科學家更指出，事實上我們每隔十一個月就會自我重塑一次。若此，我們每個人差不多都只有十一個月大；假設我們年復一年地把缺陷植入腦子裡，當然就不能怪罪他人，只能怪自己自作自受。
27. Man is the sum total of his own thoughts; so the question is, how are we going to entertain only the good thoughts and reject the evil ones? At first we can't keep the evil thoughts from coming, but we can keep from entertaining them. The only way to do this is to forget them -- which means, get something for them. This is where the ready-made affirmation comes into play.  每個人都是自身思想的總和，若此，問題在於，我們如何才能只保存有益的思維、抵制負面的念頭？一開始，我們可能無法阻隔壞念頭闖入腦子裡，但可以學著拒絕接受它，唯一的方法就是忘掉它的存在──意思是，我們應該找出其他事物取代它們。在這裡，你預先準備好的肯定語就非常適合派上用場。
28. When a thought of anger, jealousy, fear or worry creeps in, just start your affirmation going. The way to fight darkness is with light -- the way to fight cold is with heat -- the way to overcome evils is with good. For myself, I never could find any help in denials. Affirm the good, and the bad will vanish. - Frederick Elias Andrews 當憤怒、嫉妒、恐懼或擔憂等負面想法偷偷潛入心中時，請開始大聲說出你的肯定語。驅散黑暗的唯一武器就是光明、抵禦寒冷的唯一工具就是溫暖，唯有善才能驅除惡。就我自己而言，我從來就不曾從消極悲觀的想法獲得任何幫助。堅定主張一切光明美好的事物，如此一來，邪惡肯定自我退散。 ── 佛德列克．艾利亞斯．安德魯斯
29. If there is anything you require, it will be well for you to make use of this affirmation; it cannot be improved upon. Use it just as it is; take it into the silence with you, until it sinks into your subconsciousness, so that you can use it anywhere, in your car, in the office, at home; this is the advantage of spiritual methods; they are always available. Spirit is omnipresent, every ready; all that is required is a proper recognition of its omnipotence, and a willingness or desire to become the recipient of its beneficent effects. 如果你有任何想要的事物，最好的方法就是善用這句肯定語，不需任何改進修飾，請照本宣科使用這句話，將它融入你沉靜的靈魂深處，直到滲入潛意識中。如此一來，你就能隨心所欲地使用它，無論是在車上、辦公室裡還是在家中。這就是精神方法所具備的優勢，你隨時隨地都能應用。精神本來就是無處不在、永遠做好準備等你使用，你只需要真心體認到它的無所不能，並願意或渴望成為它善意的接受者。
30. If our predominant mental attitude is one of power, courage, kindliness and sympathy, we shall find that our environment will reject conditions in correspondence with these thoughts; if it is weak, critical, envious and destructive, we shall find our environment reflecting conditions corresponding to these thoughts. 如果我們的主導心態是力量、勇氣、慷慨和同情，我們就會發現，自己的周遭環境自然會排除與我們思想不合的條件，成為我們心靈狀態的映射；反之，倘若我們的主要心態是軟弱、尖苛、嫉妒與破壞，那麼環境也一定會原封不動地折射出來。
31. Thoughts are causes and conditions are effects. Herein is the explanation of the origin of both good and evil. Thought is creative and will automatically correlate with its object. This is a Cosmological law (a universal law), the law of Attraction, the law of Cause and Effect; the recognition and application of this law will determine both beginning and end; it is the law by which in all ages and in all times the people were led to believe in the power of prayer. "As thy faith is, so be it unto thee," is simply another, shorter and a better way of stating it. 思想是起因，境遇是後果，這就是善惡起源的解釋。思想具有創造性，將會自動連結它的目標，這就是所謂宇宙法則、吸引力法則，也可說是因果法則。認知並運用這法則將決定一切的開端和結局，因為它就是世世代代的人類在祈禱過程中接受引導，深信不疑的法則。「照著你們所信的，給你們成全吧。」（譯註：《聖經》馬太福音9：29）這句話不過是另一句更簡短、更妥適的敘述方式。

> 32\. This week visualize a plant; take a flower, the one you most admire, bring it from the unseen into the seen, plant the tiny seed, water it, care for it, place it where it will get the direct rays of the morning sun, see the seed burst; it is now a living thing, something which is alive and beginning to search for the means of subsistence. See the roots penetrating the earth, watch them shoot out in all directions and remember that they are living cells dividing and subdividing, and that they will soon number millions, that each cell is intelligent, that it knows what is wants and knows how to get it. See the stem shoot forward and upward, watch it burst through the surface of the earth, see it divide and form branches, see how perfect and symmetrical each branch is formed, see the leaves begin to form, and then the tiny stems, each one holding aloft a bud, and as you watch you see the bud begin to unfold and your favorite flower comes to view; and now if you will concentrate intently you will become conscious of a fragrance; it is the fragrance of the flower as the breeze gently sways the beautiful creation which you have visualized. 本週請視覺化想像一株植物。想像一朵你最喜愛的鮮花，引導它由隱不可見到清晰可見；將這顆小小的種籽種在土裡，澆灌它，細心照料它，然後將它放在陽光直射之處，觀察這顆小種籽萌芽成長。現在，它已經是活生生的植物，不僅生氣勃勃，也在尋求生存之道。看看它的根正向下延伸至土中；看看它的芽正在奮力對外伸展。也請記得不斷分裂再分裂的生命細胞，它們很快就會暴增至幾千、幾百萬顆，而且每一顆都聰明地知道自己想要什麼，又該從何處尋。看看它的綠葉向上、向前生長；看看它用力突破泥土表面；看看它分裂後形成分枝，而且每一枝都形成完美對稱的結構；看看它的葉子如何形成，然後抽出細微的莖桿，上頭都高舉一顆芽孢。當你看得目不轉睛時，花蕾就慢慢舒展開來，你最喜愛的花朵就此綻放在眼前。現在請聚精會神，你將會隱約聞到一股芳香氣味，那是花朵隨著微風輕輕搖曳散發的芳香，正是你的視覺化想像的過程產出的美麗創作。
>
> 33\. When you are enabled to make your vision clear and complete you will be enabled to enter into the spirit of a thing; it will become very real to you; you will be learning to concentrate and the process is the same, whether you are concentrating on health, a favorite flower, an ideal, a complicated business proposition or any other problem of life. 一旦你可以讓視界變得清晰明朗，就能深入事物的本質，你所想像的事物將會變得異常真實。你將學會集中心神，無論你是聚焦思考健康、熱愛的花朵、一個理想、一套複雜的商業提案，或是任何其他生活中的問題，這個過程的演進都沒有什麼兩樣。


34. Every success has been accomplished by persistent concentration upon the object in view. 當你堅定地專注在目标的畫面中時，成功必然如期而至。

"Thought means life, since those who do not think do not live in any high or real sense. Thinking makes the man." - A. B. Alcott

「思考即是生命，不去思考的人等於從未激情而真實地生活過。思考造就人生。」 —— A. B. Alcott
