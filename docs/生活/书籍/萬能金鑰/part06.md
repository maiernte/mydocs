##### INTRODUCTION

It is my privilege to enclose Part Six. This part will give you an excellent understanding of the most wonderful piece of mechanism which has ever been created. A mechanism whereby you may create for yourself Health, Strength, Success, Prosperity or any other condition which you desire. Necessities are demands, and demands create action, and actions bring about results. The process of evolution is constantly building our tomorrows out of our todays. Individual development, like Universal development, must be gradual with an ever increasing capacity and volume. 在下有幸得以隨函附上第六週的課程。本堂課會帶你充分理解，我們出生以來最奇妙的運作機制。它是一套能讓你為自己創造健康、勇氣、成功、財富及一切渴望境界的機制。有需求就會有要求，要求會創造行動，行動會產生結果。進化的過程就是以今天為基礎不斷地打造明天。個人的發展正如宇宙進化一般，伴隨著日新月異的質量與能力的發展。

The knowledge that if we infringe upon the rights of others, we become moral thorns and find ourselves entangled at every turn of the road, should be an indication that success is contingent upon the highest moral ideal, which is "The greatest good to the greatest number."
Aspiration, desire and harmonious relations constantly and persistently maintained will accomplish results. The greatest hindrance is erroneous and fixed ideas. 如果我們侵害他人的權利就會變成道德害蟲，然後發現自己的人生之路走得磕磕絆絆。由此可知，成功理當伴隨著最崇高的道德理念，也就是「為最多人謀求最大的福利」。持之以恆、堅定不懈的志向、渴望與諧調的關係將會帶來成果。而荒謬不正、執迷不悟的念頭就是最大的障礙。

To be in tune with eternal truth we must possess poise and harmony within. In order to receive intelligence the receiver must be in tune with the transmitter. 我們若想與永恆的真理同行，就必須常保內心的平衡與和諧；接收者若想獲得智慧，就必須與傳遞者同步，頻率一致。

Thought is a product of Mind and Mind is creative, but this does not mean that the Universal will change its modus operandi to suit us or our ideas, but it does mean that we can come into harmonious relationship with the Universal, and when we have accomplished this we may ask anything to which we are entitled, and the way will be made plain. 思想是心智的產物，心智深具創造力，雖然宇宙不會為了與我們或我們的思想同步而改變它的運作模式；不過它確實意味著我們可以和宇宙保持和諧良好的關係，一旦我們能做到這一點，便可大方索求自己值得擁有的一切事物，人生之路也會變成一片坦途。

##### PART SIX

1. The Universal Mind is so wonderful that it is difficult to understand its utilitarian powers and possibilities and its unlimited producing effects. 宇宙心智如此妙不可言、深不可測，所以使人難以窺見它實際的力量、可能性以及成效。
2. We have found that this Mind is not only all intelligence but all substance. How, then, is it to be differentiated in form? How are we to secure the effect which we desire? 我們已經知道，心智不單單指一切智慧，也涵蓋所有物質。若此，它又是如何分化的呢？我們究竟該如何獲取自身渴求的成果呢？
3. Ask any electrician what the effect of electricity will be and he will reply that "Electricity is a form of motion and its effect will depend upon the mechanism to which it is attached." Upon this mechanism will depend whether we shall have heat, light, power, music or any of the other marvelous demonstration of power to whichthis vital energy has been harnessed. 如果去請教電學專家何謂電能的功效，他會說：「電能是一種運動的型態，它的成效取決於所連接的裝置為何。」這種能量會以光、熱、動力、音樂或其他型態展現出來，完全取決於通上電的是什麼裝置。
4. What effect can be produced by thought? The reply is that thought is mind in motion (just as wind is air in motion), and its effect will depend entirely on the "mechanism to which it is attached." 思想能夠產生何種成果？正如起風是一種空氣流動，思想也是一種精神的行動，它的成果完全取決於所連接的裝置為何。
5. Here, then, is the secret of all mental power; it depends entirely on the mechanism which we attach. 這就是所有心靈力量的奧祕所在，完全取決於其連接的思維機制。
6. What is this mechanism? You know something of the mechanism which has been invented by Edison, Bell, Marconi and other electrical wizards, by which place and space and time have become only figures of speech, but did you ever stop to think that the mechanism which has been given you for transforming the Universal, Omnipresent Potential Power was invented by a greater inventor than Edison? 這套「機制」究竟是何物？你肯定聽過美國的湯瑪士．愛迪生（Thomas Edison）、加拿大的亞歷山大．葛萊漢．貝爾（Alexander Graham Bell）、義大利的古列爾默．馬可尼（Guglielmo Marconi）以及其他電子相關領域的奇才發明的機械裝置。這些裝置打破了時間、空間與地理限制。但你可曾稍微停下來想想，冥冥中有一位宇宙無所不在的創造者，祂遠比愛迪生偉大，賜予你改造全宇宙的機制？
7. We are accustomed to examining the mechanism of the implements which we use for tilling the soil, and we try to get an understanding of the mechanism of the automobile which we drive, but most of us are content to remain in absolute ignorance of the greatest piece of mechanism which as ever come into existence, the brain of man. 我們會想知道各種農耕器械的使用原理；我們也會先搞懂汽車的操作規程才敢駕駛上路。但是，大多數人卻甘於漠視這個有史以來最偉大的生命機制。這個所謂的生命機制就是我們的大腦。
8. Let us examine the wonders of this mechanism; perhaps we shall thereby get a better understanding of the various effects of which it is the cause. 且讓我們花點時間檢視這套機制的精妙之處，或許先從深入理解它為何可以製造出千變萬化的成果開始。
9. In the first place, there is the great mental world in which we live and move and have our being; this world is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent; it will respond to our desire in direct ratio to our purpose and faith; the purpose must be in accordance with the law of our being, that is, it must be creative or constructive; our faith must be strong enough to generate a current of sufficient strength to bring our purpose into manifestation. "As thy faith is, so be it unto thee," bears the stamp of scientific test. 首先，我們生活、行動與存在於一個浩瀚無比的心靈世界，它無所不知、無所不能、無所不在。它隨時回應我們的渴望，其回應的強度會與我們的信念、目標互成正比。我們的目標必須與我們的存在法則和諧同步，也就是說，我們的信念應該具有建設性、創造性，而且應該強大到足以產生一股豐沛的力量，得以實現我們的目標。**「你的信念有多強大，力量就有多強大。」**這句話確實禁得起科學檢驗。
10. The effects which are produced in the world without are the result of the action and reaction of the individual upon the universal; that is the process which we call thinking; the brain is the organ through which this process is accomplished; think of the wonder of it all! Do you love music, flowers, literature, or are you inspired by the thought of ancient or modern genius? Remember, every beauty to which you respond must have its corresponding outline in your brain before you can appreciate it. 外在世界所產生的結果，便是個人與宇宙之間相互作用──也就是我們稱之為「思考」的過程──所產生的結果，而我們的大腦便是進行思考活動的器官。請想想箇中的精妙之處！你是否熱愛音樂、花藝、文學，你是否曾深受古今天才的思想所啟發呢？請謹記，在你體悟所有的美感之前，其實你的大腦早已形塑一副能夠與之相對應的輪廓。
11. There is not a single virtue or principle in the storehouse of nature which the brain cannot express. The brain is an embryonic world, ready to develop at any time as necessity may arise. If you can comprehend that this is a scientific truth and one of the wonderful laws of nature, it will be easier for you to get an understanding of the mechanism by which these extraordinary results are being accomplished. 在自然的寶庫中，沒有任何一種美德或法則是大腦無法呈現的。我們的大腦是一個胚胎構成的世界，隨時準備好在必要時刻發展成形。這就是科學真理，是自然界最嘆為觀止的法則之一，如果你能理解這一點，就比較能參透各種偉大成就都是透過何種機制所創造的。
12. The nervous system has been compared to an electric circuit with its battery of cells in which force is originated, and its white matter to insulated wires by which the current is conveyed; it is through these channels that every impulse or desire is carried through the mechanism. 我們的神經系統可比喻成電力板，產生能量的細胞則扮演蓄電池的角色，白質（White Matter）就像是傳遞電流的絕緣電線，透過這些線路，才能在人體機制中傳遞各種衝動和渴望。
13. The spinal cord is the great motor and sensory pathway by which messages are conveyed to and from the brain; then, there is the blood supply plunging through the veins and arteries, renewing our energy and strength, the perfectly arranged structure upon which the entire physical body rests, and, finally, the delicate and beautiful skin, clothing the entire mechanism is a mantle of beauty. 人體的脊椎是個強大的發電機，也可說是感官的管道；用以傳遞大腦發布、接收的資訊；而暢流在血管中的血液則源源不絕地重新煥發我們的能量和氣力。此外還有我們細膩、精緻的肌膚，依附在軀體上，猶如一件美麗的斗篷包覆整個身體，形塑我們整體身心為一套完美架構。
14. This then is the "Temple of the living God" and the individual "I" is given control and upon his understanding of the mechanism which is within his control will the result depend. 這就是「永生之神的殿堂」，每一名個體的「我」都可以掌管這座殿堂，一切成就都取決於個人能否充分領悟自己掌控的這套機制。
15. Every thought sets the brain cells in action; at first the substance upon which the thought is directed fails to respond, but if the thought is sufficiently refined and concentrated, the substance finally yields and expresses perfectly. 每個思維都會灌注腦細胞一股推動力。一開始，腦細胞裡面的相應物質可能會拒絕做出回應，但如果思維夠精確、夠聚焦，腦細胞裡的物質終究會聽命行事，並完美地呈現。
16. This influence of the mind can be exerted upon any part of the body, causing the elimination of any undesirable effect. 心智的影響力可以在身體的任何部位發揮作用，也可以消除一切你不想要的結果。
17. A perfect conception and understanding of the laws governing in the mental world cannot fail to be of inestimable value in the transaction of business, as it develops the power of discernment and gives a clearer understanding and appreciation of facts. 你若能通盤理解、領悟掌控內在世界的法則，一定能在工作上產生難以估量的價值，因為它會開發你的洞察力，讓你通情達理、明察事變。
18. The man who looks within instead of without cannot fail to make use of the mighty forces which will eventually determine his course in life and so bring him into vibration with all that is best, strongest and most desirable. 一個人如果懂得關注內在世界而非外在世界，必能學會善用這股全能力量，它是決定生命進程的關鍵，並引領他的生命與世間最美好、堅固、最令人嚮往的美好願景相互共鳴。
19. Attention or concentration is probably; the most important essential in the development of mind culture. The possibilities of attention when properly directed are so startling that they would hardly appear credible to the uninitiated. **The cultivation of attention is the distinguishing characteristic of every successful man or woman, and is the very highest personal accomplishment which can be acquired.** 在開發心靈力量的過程中，全神貫注、聚精會神是至關重要的環節。一旦我們適切地集中精神意念，其成果將令人嘆為觀止。**培養專注的能力是每一位成功人士必備的特質，也是每一個人所能獲得的至高無上成就。**
20. The power of attention can be more readily understood by comparing it with a magnifying glass in which the rays of sunlight are focused; they possess no particular strength as long as the glass is moved about and the rays directed from one place to another; but let the glass be held perfectly still and let the rays be focused on one spot for any length of time, the effect will become immediately apparent. 如果我們把專注力比喻成放大鏡，就更容易理解了。放大鏡可以聚攏太陽光束，但如果拿著它晃來晃去，不斷改變光束位置，這樣放大鏡就無法集聚任何能量。不過，如果把放大鏡放在固定位置，讓光線聚攏在某一點，馬上就可以看到奇妙的效應。
21. So with the power of thought; let power be dissipated by scattering the thought from one object to another, and no result is apparent; but focus this power through attention or concentration on any single purpose for any length of time and nothing becomes impossible.  思維的力量亦然。若是任由思緒放空、漫遊太虛，力量便無法集中，也就不會創造任何成就。但如果屏氣凝神、集中意念緊盯著某一個目標，假以時日，任何事情都有可能成真。
22. A very simple remedy for a very complex situation, some will say. All right, try it, you who have had no experience in concentrating the thought on a definite purpose or object. Choose any single object and concentrate your attention on it for a definite purpose for even ten minutes; you cannot do it; the mind will wander a dozen times and it will be necessary to bring it back to the original purpose, and each time the effect will have been lost and at the end of the ten minutes nothing will have been gained, because you have not been able to hold your thought steadily to the purpose. 如果有人說這看起來很簡單，那個人肯定沒有全神貫注在某一明確標的或目標的經驗。試著做做看吧──選定一個目標，要求自己集中意念在這個明確目標十分鐘。相信你肯定做不到。因為你的思緒會動不動就飄走，你還得花時間把它們拉回來，繼續思考原定目標，只是每一次效果都不大。十分鐘過去後，你一無所獲，因為你根本無法成功地集中意念在目標上。
23. It is, however, through attention that you will finally be able to overcome obstacles of any kind that appear in your path onward and upward, and the only way to acquire this wonderful power is by practice -- practice makes perfect, in this as in anything else. 然而，一旦你循序完成聚焦意念的過程，最終就可以克服人生路途上的任何障礙。要取得這項奇妙能力的唯一方法就是練習，「熟能生巧」正是放諸四海皆準的真理。
24. In order to cultivate the power of attention, bring a photograph with you to the same seat in the same room in the same position as heretofore. Examine it closely at least ten minutes, note the expression of the eyes, the form of the features, the clothing, the way the hair is arranged; in fact, note every detail shown on the photograph carefully. Now cover it and close your eyes and try to see it mentally; if you can see every detail perfectly and can form a good mental image of the photograph, you are to be congratulated; if not, repeat the process until you can.  你若想培養專注的能力，請帶著一張人像照片，然後進入你一貫使用的空間，以同樣姿勢坐在同一張椅子上。定睛凝視這張照片至少十分鐘，留意照片中人物眼神流露的情緒、臉部特徵、衣著打扮、頭髮造型等，仔細檢視照片中的每一個細節。現在，遮住照片，閉上雙眼，試著在腦中回想這張照片。如果你能完整地回想起所有細節，以至於可以在腦海中清晰地重繪這張照片，那我就要恭喜你了。如果做不到，那就請重來一次，直到成功為止。
25. This step is simply for the purpose of preparing the soil; next week we shall be ready to sow the seed. 這個步驟的目的是準備好土壤，下星期我們將會開始播種。
26. It is by such exercises as these that you will finally be able to control your mental moods, your attitude, your consciousness. 藉由這個練習，你將學會控制情緒、心態和意識。
27. Great financiers are learning to withdraw from the multitude more and more, that they may have more time for planning, thinking and generating the right mental moods. 出色的金融家都會盡量隱世而居，為的就是遠離喧囂人群，撥出更多時間思考、計劃並培養正確的心態。
28. Successful businessmen are constantly demonstrating the fact that it pays to keep in touch with the thought of other successful business men. 成功的商業人士持續證明一個事實：個人的思維若能與其他成功的商界菁英保持同步，就能因此有所收穫。
29. A single idea may be worth millions of dollars, and these ideas can only come to those who are receptive, who are prepared to receive them, who are in successful frame of mind. 一個卓越的創意可能價值連城，但這些珍貴想法只會萌現在那些善於接納、準備接納，並且擁有成功思維人士的腦子裡。
30. Men are learning to place themselves in harmony with the Universal Mind; they are learning the unity of all things; they are learning the basic methods and principles of thinking, and this is changing conditions and multiplying results. 人們一直在學習如何與宇宙心智保持和諧同步、學習與萬事萬物保持同調、學習思維的基本法則和原理。這些都有助於改變環境，提升成果。
31. They are finding that circumstances and environment follow the trend of mental and spiritual progress; they find that growth follows knowledge; action follows inspiration; opportunity follows perception; always the spiritual first, then the transformation into the infinite and illimitable possibilities of achievement. 他們會發現，外在環境、境遇會隨著內在精神傾向、心靈成長不斷變化；他們也發現，學到知識就會成長、起心動念就會採取行動、洞察機先就能看見機會。永遠都是精神先行，接著才是無邊無際、永無止境的轉變進步。
32. As the individual is but the channel for the differentiation of the Universal, these possibilities are necessarily inexhaustible. 由於個人是宇宙分化的管道，因此這些可能性必然取之不盡、用之不竭。
33. Thought is the process by which we may absorb the Spirit of Power, and hold the result in our inner consciousness until it becomes a part of our ordinary consciousness. The method of accomplishing this result by the persistent practice of a few fundamental principles, as explained in this System, is the master-key which unlocks the storehouse of Universal Truth. 我們可以藉由思考的過程擷取靈性力量，這一點請務必銘記在心，直到它自然融入我們日常意識的一部分。要達到這個結果的方法，就是堅持不懈地實踐本書所說的基本原理──這正是一把足以打開宇宙真理寶庫的萬能金鑰。
34. The two great sources of human suffering at present are bodily disease and mental anxiety. These may be readily traced to the infringement of some Natural Law. This is, no doubt, owing to the fact that so far knowledge has largely remained partial, but the clouds of darkness which have accumulated through long ages are beginning to roll away and with them many of the miseries that attend imperfect information.人一生的苦難大致可分為兩大型態：肉身病痛與精神焦慮，這些都是因為違反了某些自然法則所引起的。之所以如此，是由於人類的某些知識至今仍深受局限。如今，過往年代日積月累的陰霾終將散去，之前因為資訊不完善所導致的種種悲慘境遇也將隨之遠離。



一旦你學會聚焦意念，就能克服任何障礙。



 "That a man can change himself, improve himself, re-create himself, control his environment, and master his own destiny is the conclusion of every mind who is wide-awake to the power of right thought in constructive action." - Larson 「當一個人全面覺知到，“正確的思考”在有建設性的行動中的力量，就能改變自身、提升自身、重塑自身、掌控周遭、並達至所願。」—— Larson
