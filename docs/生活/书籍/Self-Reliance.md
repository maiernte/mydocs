## Self-Reliance

**What is the Meaning of Self-Reliance?**

I read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which were original and not conventional. The soul always hears an admonition in such lines, let the subject be what it may. The sentiment they instil is of more value than any thought they may contain. To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men, — that is genius. Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost,—— and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the Last Judgment. Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each, the highest merit we ascribe to Moses, Plato, and Milton is, that they set at naught books and traditions, and spoke not what men but what they thought. A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty. Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. They teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with good-humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of voices is on the other side. Else, to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.

有一天，我读了几首诗，是一个杰出的画家写的，立意非常新颖，不落俗套。先不说诗的主题怎么样，字里行间传出一种告诫的意味。这些诗句中所倾注的感情的价值，远远超过了它包含的思想的价值。坚信自己的思想，坚信内心适合自己的就适合所有人——这就是所谓的天赋。如果你说出心底的信念，那么那信念就一定会变成普遍的感受；因为在适当的时候，最隐秘的就会转变成最公开的——“最后的审判”的号角会把我们最初的思想归于完善。尽管每个人都非常熟悉心灵的声音，但是我们认为摩西、柏拉图和弥尔顿最大的功绩就在于他们对书本和传统的蔑视，他们只说自己想到的东西。当心灵的微光从内部闪过，人应该学会发现和观察它，而不是去发现和观察诗人和圣贤的天空里的光彩。他却只因为那是他自己的东西，就擅自摒弃了自己的思想。我们可以在天才的每一部作品中发现我们自己抛弃的思想：它们回到了我们身边，却带着某种疏远的威严。从对我们的教益而言，伟大的作品也不过如此。它们对我们的教导是：越是对方呼声最高的时候，我们越要平心静气的坚持我们自发的感想。否则，第二天，我们曾一直想到和感受到的东西，就成了某个陌生人的高明的见解和想法，我们只能被迫从别人那里取回原本是自己的见解，而且还要满怀羞愧。

There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried. Not for nothing one face, one character, one fact, makes much impression on him, and another none. This sculpture in the memory is not without preestablished harmony. The eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it might testify of that particular ray. We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents. It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by cowards. A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise, shall give him no peace. It is a deliverance which does not deliver. In the attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends; no invention, no hope. 

每个人在求学时期的某一天都会得出这样一种信念：妒嫉就是无知，模仿等于自杀；一个人无论是好是坏，必须让命运属于自己；如果不在自己的土地上努力耕作，就不会有任何一粒有营养的粮食自己送上门——即使这广阔的宇宙不乏善举。他潜藏的力量十分奇妙，除他之外再不会有人知道他的本领，而且他也要经过尝试，否则他自己也不会知道。一张脸、一个人、一件事，在他那里而不是在另外一个人那里留下深刻印象，这不是没有原因的。铭刻在记忆中的这种东西有着提前确定的和谐。眼睛能看到那道光线，是因为它被安置在了那道光线应该照到的地方。我们无法充分的表现自己，而且我们感到羞愧——对各自所代表的那种神圣观念的羞愧。我们完全可以这样想，这种观念特别恰当，必然会创造好的结果，因此应该去忠实的传达它，可是这份功业，上帝可不愿意让懦夫来阐明。只有竭尽全力地用心工作，一个人才会感到安心和快乐；如果他并没有这样说或者这样做，那么他将不得安宁。那是一种为解脱而做的解脱。还处于尝试的阶段，他就被他的天赋所抛弃；灵感、发明、希望，全都没有。

**Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string.** Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort, and advancing on Chaos and the Dark.

信任你自己吧，每颗心都在随着那根铁弦颤动，接受你的位置吧，神圣的天意早已给你安排好了。接受和你同时代的人所构成的这个社会以及种种事件之间的联系。伟大的人物总是这样，而且把自己像孩子一样托付给同时代的天才，以此表明自己的心迹：绝对可信的东西就在他们心底藏着，通过他们的手在活动，并主导他们的存在。我们都是成年人，必须在最高尚的心灵里接受相同的超验命运；我们不是躲在安全角落的婴儿和病人，也不是革命面前临阵脱逃的懦夫，我们是领袖，是救世主，是恩人，服从上帝的旨意，冲向混沌和黑暗。

What pretty oracles nature yields us on this text, in the face and behaviour of children, babes, and even brutes! That divided and rebel mind, that distrust of a sentiment because our arithmetic has computed the strength and means opposed to our purpose, these have not. Their mind being whole, their eye is as yet unconquered, and when we look in their faces, we are disconcerted. Infancy conforms to nobody: all conform to it, so that one babe commonly makes four or five out of the adults who prattle and play to it. So God has armed youth and puberty and manhood no less with its own piquancy and charm, and made it enviable and gracious and its claims not to be put by, if it will stand by itself. Do not think the youth has no force, because he cannot speak to you and me. Hark! in the next room his voice is sufficiently clear and emphatic. It seems he knows how to speak to his contemporaries. Bashful or bold, then, he will know how to make us seniors very unnecessary.

对于这个问题，在儿童、婴儿甚至动物的脸和行为上，大自然给了我们多么神奇的启迪啊！那种分裂和叛逆的心灵，那种对某种感情的怀疑态度（我们可以计算出违背自己旨意的力量和手段），他们并不拥有。他们有完整的心灵和未被征服的眼光，当我们盯着他们看时，惴惴不安的反而是我们。幼年时不会对任何人顺从：所有人都要顺从他，所以通常是一个婴儿会让四五个逗他玩的大人都变成婴儿。同样，上帝也赋予青少年和成年人所应得的桀骜和魅力，使他受人羡慕、受人亲近，使他的要求能被重视，假如他愿意尊重自己的话。不要认为青少年不能跟我们讲话，就认为他们没用。听！在隔壁的房间，他的声音清晰而果断。看起来他知道怎样在同龄人之间谈话。羞怯也好，勇敢也好，他总会知道怎样让我们这些长辈变得无足轻重。

The nonchalance of boys who are sure of a dinner, and would disdain as much as a lord to do or say aught to conciliate one, is the healthy attitude of human nature. A boy is in the parlour what the pit is in the playhouse; independent, irresponsible, looking out from his corner on such people and facts as pass by, he tries and sentences them on their merits, in the swift, summary way of boys, as good, bad, interesting, silly, eloquent, troublesome. He cumbers himself never about consequences, about interests: he gives an independent, genuine verdict. You must court him: he does not court you. But the man is, as it were, clapped into jail by his consciousness. As soon as he has once acted or spoken with eclat, he is a committed person, watched by the sympathy or the hatred of hundreds, whose affections must now enter into his account. There is no Lethe for this. Ah, that he could pass again into his neutrality! Who can thus avoid all pledges, and having observed, observe again from the same unaffected, unbiased, unbribable, unaffrighted innocence, must always be formidable. He would utter opinions on all passing affairs, which being seen to be not private, but necessary, would sink like darts into the ear of men, and put them in fear.

小孩子不必为吃饭发愁，而且还不屑于做点什么或说点什么去讨好他人——就像贵族老爷一样，这种泰然自若的气质正是人性中的健康心态。在客厅里的孩子如同在剧院里的坐低价票座位的观众；无拘无束，不负责任，在自己的角落躲着并观察眼前的人和事，以孩子的迅速、简要的方式审讯、宣判他们的功过，他们或者好，或者坏，或者有趣，或者傻啦吧唧，或者能言善辩，或者令人生厌。因为他不去考虑后果也不必计较得失，所以能做出一种独立的、真实的判决。而你要讨好他，他却不必讨好你。成年人却不是这样，他早被自己的意识紧紧的禁锢起来了。一旦他有什么大胆的行动或者言论，立刻就相当于身陷囹圄，他受到无数的人的关注，有的同情，有的愤恨，他不得不考虑这些人的这些感情。这里没有忘川（希腊神话中的冥河之一，亡灵喝了河里的水就会忘掉一切）。他是多么想重新回到他的中立位置上去啊！所以，谁能逃避这种种誓约，或者虽然已经履行，但是还能以原来的那种不被左右、不被偏见束缚、不接受贿赂、不畏强权的纯真来履行，谁就一定能受到别人的敬畏。他经常对时事发表看法，这些看法明显不是一己之见，而是警世名言，所以非常振聋发聩，令人闻而生畏。

These are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs.

这都是我们远离人群时所听到的声音，可是一旦我们进入世界，它们就渐渐衰弱，终至无声。社会各处都在阴谋反对每个成员的阳刚之气，社会是一家股份制公司，每个成员之间都达成协议：为了向每个股东提供食物时更有把握，就必须将其他吃饭的人的自由和教养消除。其中最必备的美德就是服从，自立却是让它深恶痛绝的东西。真相和创造者，这不是社会所喜欢的东西，它喜欢的是名义和传统的规矩。

Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world. I remember an answer which when quite young I was prompted to make to a valued adviser, who was wont to importune me with the dear old doctrines of the church. On my saying, What have I to do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from within? my friend suggested, — "But these impulses may be from below, not from above." I replied, "They do not seem to me to be such; but if I am the Devil's child, I will live then from the Devil." No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature. Good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this; the only right is what is after my constitution, the only wrong what is against it. A man is to carry himself in the presence of all opposition, as if every thing were titular and ephemeral but he. I am ashamed to think how easily we capitulate to badges and names, to large societies and dead institutions. Every decent and well-spoken individual affects and sways me more than is right. I ought to go upright and vital, and speak the rude truth in all ways. If malice and vanity wear the coat of philanthropy, shall that pass? If an angry bigot assumes this bountiful cause of Abolition, and comes to me with his last news from Barbadoes, why should I not say to him, 'Go love thy infant; love thy wood-chopper: be good-natured and modest: have that grace; and never varnish your hard, uncharitable ambition with this incredible tenderness for black folk a thousand miles off. Thy love afar is spite at home.' Rough and graceless would be such greeting, but truth is handsomer than the affectation of love. Your goodness must have some edge to it, — else it is none. The doctrine of hatred must be preached as the counteraction of the doctrine of love when that pules and whines. I shun father and mother and wife and brother, when my genius calls me. The lintels of the door-post I would write on, *Whim*. It is somewhat better than whim at last I hope, but we cannot spend the day in explanation. Expect me not to show cause why I seek or why I exclude company. Then, again, do not tell me, as a good man did to-day, of my obligation to put all poor men in good situations. Are they *my* poor? I tell thee, thou foolish philanthropist, that I grudge the dollar, the dime, the cent, I give to such men as do not belong to me and to whom I do not belong. There is a class of persons to whom by all spiritual affinity I am bought and sold; for them I will go to prison, if need be; but your miscellaneous popular charities; the education at college of fools; the building of meeting-houses to the vain end to which many now stand; alms to sots; and the thousandfold Relief Societies; — though I confess with shame I sometimes succumb and give the dollar, it is a wicked dollar which by and by I shall have the manhood to withhold.

所以无论要做什么样的人，都决不能做一个顺民。想要获得永恒的荣誉，就绝不能止步于表面的善举，而是必须要弄清楚它到底是不是真正的善。说到最根本之处，除了使你自己的心灵完善，其他任何神圣之物都不存在。解脱自己，回归自我，你一定会赢得全世界的赞赏。在我小时候，有一位益友总是用教会的教条麻烦我，我还记得我是怎样不假思索的回答他的。我说，如果我是完全按照自己的内心去生活，那我与神圣的传统有什么关联？我的朋友启发我说：“这些冲动可能是自下而上的产生，而不是自上而下。”我回答说：“未必吧。不过假如我是魔鬼之子，那么就让我按魔鬼的生活来生活好了。”依我看，除了我的天性这个法则，再也没有其他任何神圣的法则。好坏不过是一些名义上的说辞，随便那里都可以挪用。只要是符合我的性格的东西就是正确的，违背的就是错误的。一个人在所有反对势力面前修身做事，仿佛一切都是有名无实，过眼烟云，唯独他是例外。一想到我们轻易的向徽章和虚名，向大社会和死体制投降，我就感到羞愧难当。每一个举止得当、谈吐优雅的个人比起真理来更能影响和触动我。我应该昂首挺胸充满气势地走路，想方设法地直言不讳。假如怨恨和空虚穿着慈善的外衣，将行得通吗？如果一个怒气冲冲的、顽固到底的人设想慷慨宽大的废奴运动，带着来自巴巴多斯的最新消息来找我，我为什么不能对他说：“关心你的孩子去吧，关心你的伐木工人去吧：要和善、谦逊，要有气质，想要用对万里之外的黑人表现出来的关心来掩饰你那咄咄逼人的野心简直是痴心妄想。你对远处表现的爱就是对自家的恨。”这样向人致意虽然粗鲁不逊，但是说真话要比假仁假义更合适。你的善良必须要比较尖锐——否则就算不上什么善良。仇恨论低泣和抱怨的时候必须要被宣扬成仁爱论的对策。我会在我的天才召唤我的时候避开父母妻子和兄弟。我要在门楣上写下“想入非非”。我还是盼着最终结果能比想入非非好一些，但是我们不能把整天的时间都浪费在解释上面。别指望我会说明我为什么想群居或者独居。也别像如今的善人的那些做法，对我说什么有改变所有穷人处境的义务。那些穷人，他们是我的吗？我告诉你，你这笨蛋善人，我不会把钱送给那些我们彼此互不相干的人，一分都舍不得。由于有种种精神上的共鸣，对某一个阶层的人，我是可以由他们随意调遣的；如有必要，我不惜为他们赴汤蹈火。但偏偏不做你那些各种名义的廉价的慈善活动；不参与那些愚人学校的教育；不建造那徒劳无功的教堂，况且现在已经造了很多，基本都没什么用；不向酒鬼施舍；不组织那些反复重复的救济团体——虽然我也会略有羞愧的承认：我不得不在有时候破费一块钱，可是那是毫无善意的一块钱，不久之后，我就有勇气不给了。

Virtues are, in the popular estimate, rather the exception than the rule. There is the man *and* his virtues. Men do what is called a good action, as some piece of courage or charity, much as they would pay a fine in expiation of daily non-appearance on parade. Their works are done as an apology or extenuation of their living in the world, — as invalids and the insane pay a high board. Their virtues are penances. I do not wish to expiate, but to live. My life is for itself and not for a spectacle. I much prefer that it should be of a lower strain, so it be genuine and equal, than that it should be glittering and unsteady. Wish it to be sound and sweet, and not to need diet and bleeding. The primary evidence I ask that you are a man, and refuse this appeal from the man to his actions. For myself it makes no difference that I know, whether I do or forbear those actions which are reckoned excellent. I cannot consent to pay for a privilege where I have intrinsic right. Few and mean as my gifts may be, I actually am, and do not need for my own assurance or the assurance of my fellows any secondary testimony.

通常认为，美德完全是意外之举，而非规则。人跟他的品德是两码事。人做的那些所谓的善举，如见义勇为、扶危济困之类，就跟他们必须为不参加日常的游行而缴纳罚金作为抵偿一样。他们干这种事只算是他们在这个世界上生活的一种赔罪或掩饰——好比病人和精神病患者交的巨额的伙食费一样。他们的美德就是苦修赎罪。我不想赎罪，我只想生活。我只为生活而生活，并非为了观赏。我更希望它能低调一些，好能真实而平等，而不愿意它光彩照人，动荡不安。我希望它健康甜美，不必去忍受饥饿和病痛。我要的是“你是个人”这样主要的证据，而不是脱离了人只论及他的行动。我知道，对于那些所谓的高明行动，无论我是做了还是避免，于我本身来说其实无关紧要。我拒绝在我已经拥有权力的地方再购买特权。我虽然无德无能，却是一个真实的存在，因此没必要为了让我自己或我的同伴安心而要求别人给予保证。

**What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think.**This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is the harder, because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. The easy thing in the world is to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.

人们所想的事与我无关，我必须做的只是与我有关的事。这一规定，在现实生活和精神生活中同样至关重要，所以伟大和渺小完全可以据此来区分。因为你总会发现一些这样的人，他们觉得他们比你还清楚你自己的职责是什么，因此，这一规定显得更加严厉了。在世界上，以世人的观点生活很容易；在隐居时，以自己的想法生活也不难；可是伟人之所以是伟人，就在于他能在无数俗人之中完美的保持了特立独行的个性。

The objection to conforming to usages that have become dead to you is, that it scatters your force. It loses your time and blurs the impression of your character. If you maintain a dead church, contribute to a dead Bible-society, vote with a great party either for the government or against it, spread your table like base housekeepers, — under all these screens I have difficulty to detect the precise man you are. And, of course, so much force is withdrawn from your proper life. But do your work, and I shall know you. Do your work, and you shall reinforce yourself. A man must consider what a blindman's-buff is this game of conformity. If I know your sect, I anticipate your argument. I hear a preacher announce for his text and topic the expediency of one of the institutions of his church. Do I not know beforehand that not possibly can he say a new and spontaneous word? With all this ostentation of examining the grounds of the institution, do I not know that he will do no such thing? Do not I know that he is pledged to himself not to look but at one side, — the permitted side, not as a man, but as a parish minister? He is a retained attorney, and these airs of the bench are the emptiest affectation. Well, most men have bound their eyes with one or another handkerchief, and attached themselves to some one of these communities of opinion. This conformity makes them not false in a few particulars, authors of a few lies, but false in all particulars. Their every truth is not quite true. Their two is not the real two, their four not the real four; so that every word they say chagrins us, and we know not where to begin to set them right. Meantime nature is not slow to equip us in the prison-uniform of the party to which we adhere. We come to wear one cut of face and figure, and acquire by degrees the gentlest asinine expression. There is a mortifying experience in particular, which does not fail to wreak itself also in the general history; I mean "the foolish face of praise," the forced smile which we put on in company where we do not feel at ease in answer to conversation which does not interest us. The muscles, not spontaneously moved, but moved by a low usurping wilfulness, grow tight about the outline of the face with the most disagreeable sensation.

反对顺从一些对你来说已经僵化死去的习俗的原因，就在于它会分散你的精力，耗费你的时间，模糊你的人格。如果你支持一座僵化死去的教堂，为一个僵化死去的圣经社会效命，跟随一个大的政党去投票支持或反对政府，像白痴的管家婆一样摆你的餐桌——在这一切的遮掩下，让我发现真正的你是很难的。不过，做你自己的事，我就会了解你。做你自己的事，你就会让自己充实。一个人必须明白：顺从这种手段根本是捉迷藏。假如我知道你的派别，我就会预测出你的论调。我听说一位牧师把该教会制定的一项规章制度宣布为布道的题目。他根本说不出一句新鲜自然的话，我难道不会事先得知？尽管他夸夸其谈该项制度的存在依据，他却百分之百不会去做那样的事，对此我难道不清楚吗？他保证只看问题被允许看的那一方面，以一个牧师的身份去看，而不是以人的身份去看，我难道不知道？他是一个被聘请的律师，法官席上的好些派头都是空洞到极点的装模作样。唉，大多数人都把自己的眼睛用一块手绢蒙住了，并把自己束缚到某一个普遍适用的观点上。这种顺从不仅让他们在几件事上弄虚作假，编造谎言，而是对所有的事情都阳奉阴违。他们的每个真理都说不上真。他们二不是二，四也不是四；所以我对他们说过的每句话都懊恼万分，我们不知道让他们改邪归正的着手点在哪里。与此同时，我们被本性急不可耐地套上我们所追随的党派的囚服。我们慢慢地长成同样的脸孔和身材，慢慢的学会了最温顺的愚蠢的表情。特别是有一种禁欲修行的经历，它也在一般历史中成功的大显身手，我说的是那“赞颂的蠢脸”，那勉强笑容，那是我们在与人相处，在我们对谈话毫无兴趣却要寒暄时假装出来的。肌肉活动不是自然的，而是被一种低劣不堪、跋扈蛮横的力量所牵弄着，紧紧的在脸的轮廓上绷着，心不甘情不愿的。

For nonconformity the world whips you with its displeasure. And therefore a man must know how to estimate a sour face. The by-standers look askance on him in the public street or in the friend's parlour. If this aversation had its origin in contempt and resistance like his own, he might well go home with a sad countenance; but the sour faces of the multitude, like their sweet faces, have no deep cause, but are put on and off as the wind blows and a newspaper directs. Yet is the discontent of the multitude more formidable than that of the senate and the college. It is easy enough for a firm man who knows the world to brook the rage of the cultivated classes. Their rage is decorous and prudent, for they are timid as being very vulnerable themselves. But when to their feminine rage the indignation of the people is added, when the ignorant and the poor are aroused, when the unintelligent brute force that lies at the bottom of society is made to growl and mow, it needs the habit of magnanimity and religion to treat it godlike as a trifle of no concernment.

因为不顺从，世人就对你处处不满，大加鞭笞。因此一个人必须学会判断别人的脸色。无论在街上还是朋友的客厅里，他都会遭人白眼。假如这种反感像他自己一样也来自鄙视和抵触，他不如耷拉着脸回家算了。但是人民生气的脸孔跟他们欢喜的脸孔一样，并没有什么深层的原因，而只是随着社会舆论的导向而被操纵着转换。不过比起议院和学校的不满，群情激愤要可怕多了。一个有丰富阅历的坚强人物，忍受有教养的阶级的愤怒算不上难事。他们的愤怒有所节制，因为他们本身胆小如鼠，本来就不堪一击。但是，如果在他们阴沉的愤怒之外再加上人民的愤怒，如果再有被鼓动起来的无知的穷人，如果还有被激发起来嗷嗷咆哮，龇牙咧嘴的社会最底层的野蛮势力，那么就只能需要极大的胸怀和宗教修养大显身手，把它大事化小小事化了的对待了。

The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word, because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them.

让我们不敢自信的另一个恐惧就在于我们总是要求前后一致；将我们过去的言行奉为金科玉律，因为在别人的眼里，除了我们过去的言行，再也没有其他用以推测我们为人处世的依据了，而且我们也不愿意让他们失望。

But why should you keep your head over your shoulder? Why drag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have stated in this or that public place? Suppose you should contradict yourself; what then? It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone, scarcely even in acts of pure memory, but to bring the past for judgment into the thousand-eyed present, and live ever in a new day. In your metaphysics you have denied personality to the Deity: yet when the devout motions of the soul come, yield to them heart and life, though they should clothe God with shape and color. Leave your theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and flee.

但是为什么你要有头脑呢？为什么将你腐朽的记忆拖来拖去，惟恐与你在某个场合发表的言论自相矛盾呢？就算你自相矛盾，那又算得了什么？智慧的标准之一似乎就是绝不一味的依赖你的记忆，甚至也不怎么信赖纯粹的记忆行为，而是把过去带进现实，在众目睽睽之下进行判定，并且永远生活在一个新时代里。你已经在你的形而上学里拒绝了对上帝赋予人格：然而当灵魂的种种虔诚的意向到来的时候，那就尽心尽力的服从它们好了，尽管他们竟然赋予了上帝形形色色的外表。抛弃你的学说逃跑吧，就像约瑟夫把他的外衣丢在妓女手里那样。

A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. — 'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.' — Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.

愚蠢的一致性是心灵卑微猥琐的表现，却受到小政客、小哲学家和小牧师的顶礼膜拜。如果强求墨守陈规，伟大的灵魂就将一无所成。他还不如去关心自己在墙上的影子。现在你有什么念头，就坚定地说出来吧，尽管它可能跟你今天所有的事都自相矛盾——“啊，那么你肯定会被人误解的。”但是被人误解真的那么可怕吗？毕达哥拉斯（公元前6世纪希腊哲学家、数学家）被人误解过，苏格拉底、耶稣、路德、哥白尼、伽利略、牛顿，凡是有血有肉的每一个纯洁和智慧的精神都是这样。想要伟大就注定要被人误解。

**I suppose no man can violate his nature.** All the sallies of his will are rounded in by the law of his being, as the inequalities of Andes and Himmaleh are insignificant in the curve of the sphere. Nor does it matter how you gauge and try him. A character is like an acrostic or Alexandrian stanza; — read it forward, backward, or across, it still spells the same thing. In this pleasing, contrite wood-life which God allows me, let me record day by day my honest thought without prospect or retrospect, and, I cannot doubt, it will be found symmetrical, though I mean it not, and see it not. My book should smell of pines and resound with the hum of insects. The swallow over my window should interweave that thread or straw he carries in his bill into my web also. We pass for what we are. Character teaches above our wills. Men imagine that they communicate their virtue or vice only by overt actions, and do not see that virtue or vice emit a breath every moment.

我想，没有谁能违背自己的本性。他迸发的感情源于自身的存在规律，就好象安第斯山和喜马拉雅山尽管起伏不断，但在地球的曲线中仍然显得微不足道。无论你怎么衡量、揣度一个人，都无关紧要。一个人的性格就像离合体诗歌或亚历山大体诗歌——无论正读、倒读、斜读，拼出的字母都一样。上帝准许我过这种让人愉悦、表示悔过的丛林生活，在这种生活中，让我不会瞻前顾后，只需要每天记录下自己真诚的思想。尽管我无意为之，也看不出它所具有的性质，但我毫不怀疑，人们将会发现这种思想的对称和和谐。我的书应该散发松树的香气，回响着昆虫的鸣叫。我窗前的燕子应该用它嘴上叼着的线头、草叶来为我筑巢。我们是什么样，别人就会把我们看成什么样。性格教育的作用远远高于我们的意志。人们总是认为只能通过外部行为展示善或恶，却不知道，善或恶时时刻刻都在自己散发着一种气息。

There will be an agreement in whatever variety of actions, so they be each honest and natural in their hour. For of one will, the actions will be harmonious, however unlike they seem. These varieties are lost sight of at a little distance, at a little height of thought. One tendency unites them all. The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred tacks. See the line from a sufficient distance, and it straightens itself to the average tendency. Your genuine action will explain itself, and will explain your other genuine actions. Your conformity explains nothing. Act singly, and what you have already done singly will justify you now. Greatness appeals to the future. If I can be firm enough to-day to do right, and scorn eyes, I must have done so much right before as to defend me now. Be it how it will, do right now. Always scorn appearances, and you always may. The force of character is cumulative. All the foregone days of virtue work their health into this. What makes the majesty of the heroes of the senate and the field, which so fills the imagination? The consciousness of a train of great days and victories behind. They shed an united light on the advancing actor. He is attended as by a visible escort of angels. That is it which throws thunder into Chatham's voice, and dignity into Washington's port, and America into Adams's eye. Honor is venerable to us because it is no ephemeris. It is always ancient virtue. We worship it to-day because it is not of to-day. We love it and pay it homage, because it is not a trap for our love and homage, but is self-dependent, self-derived, and therefore of an old immaculate pedigree, even if shown in a young person.

尽管人的行为千差万别，但是总会存在着一种一致性，这样，任何一个行动都会在它们的关键时刻显得实实在在。因为都是出于同一个意愿，所以无论行为看上去有多大差别，结果必将是和谐统一的。在一定距离、一定高度的时候，那种行为上的多样性就看不出来了。一种趋势让它们都连为一体了。最好的船只的航线也都是蜿蜒曲折的。如果从远处看这条航线，它就趋于笔直了。你真正的行动会解释明白你自己，也会解释明白你其他的真正行动。墨守陈规不能解释任何事情。独立行动吧，你独立做的事情从现在开始就会证明你的正确。伟大诉诸于未来。如果我今天确信自己做对了事情，并且蔑视别人的眼光，那就表明我先前的正确行为正在为今天的自己做辩护。不管未来什么样，现在就把事情做对。如果你能永远蔑视外表，那么你就能永远把事情做对。人格的力量是不断积累的。以前的种种善举都会让今天的我们受益。是什么造就了议会和战场中的英雄们让人心潮澎湃的威严。是因为过去曾经拥有的光辉岁月和辉煌战绩。这些光辉岁月和辉煌战绩汇成一束光辉，把勇往直前的行动者照亮。仿佛一队看得见的天使在护送着他。正是这个东西让查塔姆伯爵声如雷鸣，让华盛顿的举止威严，让美国进入了亚当斯的眼睛。荣誉之所以让我们充满敬意，是因为它不是转瞬即逝的东西。它一直是传统的美德。今天我们之所以崇拜它，恰恰因为它不属于今天。我们对它热爱、敬仰，只因为它不是为捕捉我们的热爱与敬仰所布下的陷阱，而是自力更生，因而具有一种古老纯洁的血统，即使在一个年轻人身上表现出来，也是这样。

I hope in these days we have heard the last of conformity and consistency. Let the words be gazetted and ridiculous henceforward. Instead of the gong for dinner, let us hear a whistle from the Spartan fife. Let us never bow and apologize more. A great man is coming to eat at my house. I do not wish to please him; He should wish to please me, that I wish. I will stand here for humanity, and though I would make it kind, I would make it true. Let us affront and reprimand the smooth mediocrity and squalid contentment of the times, and hurl in the face of custom, and trade, and office, the fact which is the upshot of all history, that there is a great responsible Thinker and Actor working wherever a man works; that a true man belongs to no other time or place, but is the centre of things. Where he is, there is nature. He measures you, and all men, and all events. Ordinarily, every body in society reminds us of somewhat else, or of some other person. Character, reality, reminds you of nothing else; it takes place of the whole creation. The man must be so much, that he must make all circumstances indifferent. Every true man is a cause, a country, and an age; requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design; — and posterity seem to follow his steps as a train of clients. A man Caesar is born, and for ages after we have a Roman Empire. Christ is born, and millions of minds so grow and cleave to his genius, that he is confounded with virtue and the possible of man. An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man; as, Monachism, of the Hermit Antony; the Reformation, of Luther; Quakerism, of Fox; Methodism, of Wesley; Abolition, of Clarkson. Scipio, Milton called "the height of Rome"; and all history resolves itself very easily into the biography of a few stout and earnest persons.

我希望今天我们已经是最后一次听到顺从和墨守陈规。从今往后就让这两个词宣布作废，并变得荒谬可笑。让我们听到的不再是开饭的锣声，而是斯巴达横笛吹出的美妙旋律。让我们再也不必卑躬屈膝、赔礼道歉了。一位伟大的人物要来我家吃饭，我可没有讨好他的意思，我倒希望他应该是来讨好我的。我要站在这里维护人性，尽管我想让他仁慈博爱，但我更愿意他能真心实意。让我们与举世为敌的情况下侮辱和斥责当代那些圆滑世故、自以为是的作风，并把一切已经成为历史结论的事实扔到习俗、贸易和政务的面前：哪里有劳作的人，哪里就有一个伟大负责的思想家和活动家在发挥作用；一个真正的人不属于任何时空，而是所有事物的中心。凡是他出现的地方，就会有天性和自然。他衡量你以及一切人和事。通常，社会上的每一个人使我联想到别的某件事或者某个人。性格和现实让你联想不到任何别的东西；他就是世间所有的东西。人必须要做到顶天立地，使得周围的一切环境都显得无足轻重。每一个真正的人就是一个起因、一个国家、一个时代；他的宏伟计划需要无限的空间、人员和时间来完成——而子孙后代就是这一计划的忠实追随者。凯撒诞生了，很多时代过去之后我们拥有了一个罗马帝国。基督诞生了，无数心灵依附着他，忠心耿耿，久而久之，又把美德和他的潜能融为一体。一种制度是一个人的延长了的影子，好比古代隐士安东尼与修道院，路德与宗教改革，福克斯与贵格会，卫斯理与卫理公会，克拉克森与废奴运动，而西庇阿被弥尔顿称为“罗马之巅”。一切历史都可以易如反掌地把自己融入少数几个勇敢坚定的人的传记之中去。

Let a man then know his worth, and keep things under his feet. Let him not peep or steal, or skulk up and down with the air of a charity-boy, a bastard, or an interloper, in the world which exists for him. But the man in the street, finding no worth in himself which corresponds to the force which built a tower or sculptured a marble god, feels poor when he looks on these. To him a palace, a statue, or a costly book have an alien and forbidding air, much like a gay equipage, and seem to say like that, 'Who are you, Sir?' Yet they all are his, suitors for his notice, petitioners to his faculties that they will come out and take possession. The picture waits for my verdict: it is not to command me, but I am to settle its claims to praise. That popular fable of the sot who was picked up dead drunk in the street, carried to the duke's house, washed and dressed and laid in the duke's bed, and, on his waking, treated with all obsequious ceremony like the duke, and assured that he had been insane, owes its popularity to the fact, that it symbolizes so well the state of man, who is in the world a sort of sot, but now and then wakes up, exercises his reason, and finds himself a true prince.

那么就让一个人认清自己的价值吧，然后把万物都踩在自己的脚下。他不必像可怜的被救助的孤儿、私生子，或者爱管闲事的人那样偷偷摸摸、鬼鬼祟祟、躲躲藏藏，这个世界是为他而存在的。可是一个街上的普通人并不懂得寻找自我价值，他在看着一个高塔或者一尊大理石神像的时候，就会自惭形秽，因为他不知道发现自己身上的价值要比制造高塔和雕刻神像所费的时间还要多。在他看来，一座宫殿，一尊雕像，甚至一本贵重的书，都拥有一种令人无法接近的傲慢神情，很像一个衣着华丽的马车夫，似乎对人这样说：“你是谁啊，先生？”其实这一切都是属于他的，都在吸引他的注意，并盼望他将它们弄到手。那幅画不是在向我发号施令，而是在等着我去鉴定，并由我来决定它是否有获得赞赏的资格。有一个家喻户晓的寓言故事，一个醉鬼烂醉如泥的躺在街上，被人抬到公爵府上，给他梳洗打扮干净后把他放在公爵床上，等他醒来之后，他被以公爵之礼对待，人们极尽阿谀奉承之能事，并向他保证说他只是一度神志不清。这个寓言之所以讨人喜欢，是因为它恰到好处的象征了人的生存状态，人活着就是一个醉鬼，但是有时候就会清醒过来，恢复理智，然后发现自己原本就是一个真正的王子。

Our reading is mendicant and sycophantic. In history, our imagination plays us false. Kingdom and lordship, power and estate, are a gaudier vocabulary than private John and Edward in a small house and common day's work; but the things of life are the same to both; the sum total of both is the same. Why all this deference to Alfred, and Scanderbeg, and Gustavus? Suppose they were virtuous; did they wear out virtue? As great a stake depends on your private act to-day, as followed their public and renowned steps. When private men shall act with original views, the lustre will be transferred from the actions of kings to those of gentlemen.

我们读书就等于乞讨、谄媚。在历史中，我们被自己的想象所欺骗。王国和贵族，权利和庄园，比起小家小户的日常工作中的普通小人物约翰和爱德华来，要更加堂皇。可是对两者来说，生活中的事情是相同的，两者的总数也是一样的。为什么要对阿尔弗列德、斯坎德贝和古斯塔夫尊崇备至呢？就算他们功高盖世吧，难道他们包揽了整个天下的所有恩德？今天，一个人的得失全靠自己的个人行为，就像从前那些生命赫赫的人物要借助追随者的脚步一样。一旦普通百姓做事的时候有了自己独到的见解，国王行为上的光辉就会转移到仁人志士的行为上了。

The world has been instructed by its kings, who have so magnetized the eyes of nations. It has been taught by this colossal symbol the mutual reverence that is due from man to man. The joyful loyalty with which men have everywhere suffered the king, the noble, or the great proprietor to walk among them by a law of his own, make his own scale of men and things, and reverse theirs, pay for benefits not with money but with honor, and represent the law in his person, was the hieroglyphic by which they obscurely signified their consciousness of their own right and comeliness, the right of every man.

世界一直处于国王们的引导中，像磁石一样，他们吸引着各个国家的注意力。他们教导世人要互敬互重。国王这个高尚或伟大的业主，按他自己的法律在人们中间活动，制定他自己待人接物的标准，推翻他人的标准，以荣誉而非钱财进行奖励，以个人意志代替法律。对于以上种种做法，人们处处任其所为，他们所表现出来的赤胆忠心就等于一种象形文字，大家朦胧的用它象征他们关心自己应当享有的权利以及个人享有的权利的意识。

**The magnetism which all original action exerts is explained when we inquire the reason of self-trust.** Who is the Trustee? What is the aboriginal Self, on which a universal reliance may be grounded? What is the nature and power of that science-baffling star, without parallax, without calculable elements, which shoots a ray of beauty even into trivial and impure actions, if the least mark of independence appear? The inquiry leads us to that source, at once the essence of genius, of virtue, and of life, which we call Spontaneity or Instinct. We denote this primary wisdom as Intuition, whilst all later teachings are tuitions. In that deep force, the last fact behind which analysis cannot go, all things find their common origin. For, the sense of being which in calm hours rises, we know not how, in the soul, is not diverse from things, from space, from light, from time, from man, but one with them, and proceeds obviously from the same source whence their life and being also proceed. We first share the life by which things exist, and afterwards see them as appearances in nature, and forget that we have shared their cause. Here is the fountain of action and of thought. Here are the lungs of that inspiration which giveth man wisdom, and which cannot be denied without impiety and atheism. We lie in the lap of immense intelligence, which makes us receivers of its truth and organs of its activity. When we discern justice, when we discern truth, we do nothing of ourselves, but allow a passage to its beams. If we ask whence this comes, if we seek to pry into the soul that causes, all philosophy is at fault. Its presence or its absence is all we can affirm. Every man discriminates between the voluntary acts of his mind, and his involuntary perceptions, and knows that to his involuntary perceptions a perfect faith is due. He may err in the expression of them, but he knows that these things are so, like day and night, not to be disputed. My wilful actions and acquisitions are but roving; — the idlest reverie, the faintest native emotion, command my curiosity and respect. Thoughtless people contradict as readily the statement of perceptions as of opinions, or rather much more readily; for, they do not distinguish between perception and notion. They fancy that I choose to see this or that thing. But perception is not whimsical, but fatal. If I see a trait, my children will see it after me, and in course of time, all mankind, — although it may chance that no one has seen it before me. For my perception of it is as much a fact as the sun.

一旦我们开始追究自信的根源，所有的原始行为展现出来的魅力都将迎刃而解。谁是那受信赖的人？一种普遍的依赖所基于的原始的“自我”又是什么？那没有视差，没有可测元素，科学难以探究的恒星，其本质是什么呢？让它们将美丽的光束投入到那些猥琐卑劣的行为中的力量是什么？这种探究让我们追根溯源，原来那既是天才的本质，又是美德和生命的本质的根源，我们把它称为“自发行为”或者“本能”。这种基本的智慧我们称之为“直觉”，之后的教导则都是“教诲”。在那种深奥的力量，也就是无法分析的终极事实中，所有的事物发现了它们共同的根源。生存感是在不知不觉中悄无声息的在个人身上产生的，它跟万物、空间、光、时间、人不仅没有什么不同，反而跟它们合为一体，显然，也是从它们的生命与存在所产生的同一个根源上产生的。我们起初与万物共同生存，随后才将他们视为自然界的张张面孔，而忘记了我们共同的起源。思想和行动的源泉就在这里。这就是产生赋予人智慧和呼吸的器官，只有无神论者才会予以否认。我们置身于无垠的智慧之中，接受真理并为之效力。当我们发现正义以及真理时，我们不必主动做任何事情，而只须给它的光辉让路即可。我们要是究其来源，试图窥视造成万物起因的灵魂，所有的哲学就无处着手了。它的存不存在就是我们所能证实的全部。每个人都能够区别他自己心灵中的自主行为和无意识行为，而且知道绝对的信仰的原因就在于那些无意识的行为。虽然他会表达不当，但是他知道这些东西就像知道白昼和黑夜一样无可置疑。我故意的行为与获得总是飘忽不定——漫无边际的幻想，微乎其微的自然感情，驾驭着我的好奇和动机。思想空洞的人在述说知觉和见解时常会自相矛盾，因为他不能对知觉和观念加以区分。他们满以为对一件事而言，我想看见这件就是这件，想看见那件就是那件。然而知觉不等于异想天开，而是必然存在。如果我看见了一种特性，随后我的孩子也会看到，最后，整个人类全都会看到——虽然很凑巧的是在我之前无人看到。因为我对它的知觉犹如天上的太阳一样，是一个显而易见的事实。

The relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so pure, that it is profane to seek to interpose helps. It must be that when God speaketh he should communicate, not one thing, but all things; should fill the world with his voice; should scatter forth light, nature, time, souls, from the centre of the present thought; and new date and new create the whole. Whenever a mind is simple, and receives a divine wisdom, old things pass away, — means, teachers, texts, temples fall; it lives now, and absorbs past and future into the present hour. All things are made sacred by relation to it, — one as much as another. All things are dissolved to their centre by their cause, and, in the universal miracle, petty and particular miracles disappear. If, therefore, a man claims to know and speak of God, and carries you backward to the phraseology of some old mouldered nation in another country, in another world, believe him not. Is the acorn better than the oak which is its fulness and completion? Is the parent better than the child into whom he has cast his ripened being? Whence, then, this worship of the past? The centuries are conspirators against the sanity and authority of the soul. Time and space are but physiological colors which the eye makes, but the soul is light; where it is, is day; where it was, is night; and history is an impertinence and an injury, if it be any thing more than a cheerful apologue or parable of my being and becoming.

灵魂和神灵间的关系非常纯洁，所以想要寻求外来帮助反而会有亵渎的嫌疑。情况必然如此：上帝说话的时候，他要传达的是所有事而不是一件事；他的声音会响彻全世界；他应该从现在思想的中心散播出光明、自然、时间、灵魂，把全体从头开始，重新改造。纯真的心灵接受一种神圣的智慧的时候，古老的东西就会烟消云散——手段、导师、经文、寺庙，全都土崩瓦解；这个心灵在现在生活，把过去和未来全部都融入现在。所有与之相关的事物都显得无比神圣——而且彼此平等。所有事物都被它们的起因融进他们的中心，而且在普遍的奇迹中，那些小规模的、特殊的奇迹就消失了。因此，假如一个人自称了解上帝，谈及上帝，而且使你回想起另一个世界、另一个国家的某个灭亡了的古老民族的用语时，无视他的话吧。作出完美表现的应该是橡果而不是橡树吧。一个人把自己成熟的存在贯彻到父亲身上而不是孩子身上，对吧？所以，为什么产生这种对过去的崇拜呢？过去的每个世纪都在阴谋反对健全的心智与心灵的权威。时间和空间不过是眼睛造成的生理颜色而已，但灵魂却是光明。它出现的地方就是白昼，它消失的地方就是黑夜。如果历史不仅仅是关于我的存在和形成的一种令人愉快的寓言的话，那它就是一种鲁莽的行为，一种伤人的举动。

Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; 'I think,' 'I am,' that he dares not say, but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence. Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less. Its nature is satisfied, and it satisfies nature, in all moments alike. But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.

人总是谨小慎微，唯唯诺诺；他不再刚强正直；他没勇气说“我认为”，“我就是”，而是一直引用先贤的名言。面对一片草叶和一朵盛开的玫瑰他会感到无地自容。不管是从前的玫瑰花，还是更好的玫瑰花，我窗前的玫瑰花总是满足于它们自己的现状；今天它们为自己而生，与上帝同在。对它们而言，没有时间，有的只是玫瑰。它存在的时时刻刻都是尽善尽美的。在嫩叶绽开之前，它的整个生命就开始发挥作用了；在盛开的花朵里看不出它的多；在光秃秃的根部也看不出它的少。它的天性被满足了，他也满足了大自然，任何时刻都一样。可是人却总在拖延、总在回忆，他不在现在生活，而是回首往事，哀悼过去，要不就不理会周围的财富，却掂起脚尖展望未来。如果他不和自然一起超越时间，生活在现在，那么他就不会拥有快乐和坚强。

This should be plain enough. Yet see what strong intellects dare not yet hear God himself, unless he speak the phraseology of I know not what David, or Jeremiah, or Paul. We shall not always set so great a price on a few texts, on a few lives. We are like children who repeat by rote the sentences of grandames and tutors, and, as they grow older, of the men of talents and character they chance to see, — painfully recollecting the exact words they spoke; afterwards, when they come into the point of view which those had who uttered these sayings, they understand them, and are willing to let the words go; for, at any time, they can use words as good when occasion comes. If we live truly, we shall see truly. It is as easy for the strong man to be strong, as it is for the weak to be weak. When we have new perception, we shall gladly disburden the memory of its hoarded treasures as old rubbish. When a man lives with God, his voice shall be as sweet as the murmur of the brook and the rustle of the corn.

这点应该是不言而喻的。可是看看那些坚强的智者竟然没勇气听上帝本人的教诲，除非他说的是我所知甚少的大卫、耶利米或者保罗的语句。我们不能永远抱定几篇经文、几个传记。我们就像小孩子一样，死记硬背老太太、家庭教师教的话，等长大后，还要死记硬背偶然看见的有才华、有个性的人们的箴言——不知辛劳的背诵他们说过的原话；后来，便开始赞成这些人话语中蕴含的观点，加以理解后才愿意丢开那些原话；因为此时他们可以随时随地恰当地运用那些话了。如果我们活得真实，我们就会观察地真实。那就像强者保持坚强或者弱者保持软弱一样容易。一旦我们拥有新知，我们就会很乐意像处理以前的垃圾一样把储藏的财宝从记忆里清除。谁能与上帝生活在一起，谁的声音就能像溪水的潺潺声和稻田的沙沙声一样的美妙。

And now at last the highest truth on this subject remains unsaid; probably cannot be said; for all that we say is the far-off remembering of the intuition. That thought, by what I can now nearest approach to say it, is this. When good is near you, when you have life in yourself, it is not by any known or accustomed way; you shall not discern the foot-prints of any other; not see the face of man; and you shall not hear any name;—— the way, the thought, the good, shall be wholly strange and new. It shall exclude example and experience. You take the way from man, not to man. All persons that ever existed are its forgotten ministers. Fear and hope are alike beneath it. There is somewhat low even in hope. In the hour of vision, there is nothing that can be called gratitude, nor properly joy. The soul raised over passion beholds identity and eternal causation, perceives the self-existence of Truth and Right, and calms itself with knowing that all things go well. Vast spaces of nature, the Atlantic Ocean, the South Sea, — long intervals of time, years, centuries, — are of no account. This which I think and feel underlay every former state of life and circumstances, as it does underlie my present, and what is called life, and what is called death.

到目前为止，关于这一论题的最高真理仍未言明；大概也无法言明，因为我们所谈到的一切不过是对直觉的遥远的记忆而已。下面这样的情况，就是我通过现在最能接近的手段来表达的那种思想。当幸福向你靠近时，拥有自己的生命之时，一切都是非同寻常的，你无法发现别人的足迹；你无法看见别人的脸孔；你听不到任何名字——那种渠道、思想、幸福必然是极端新颖的。实例和经验必定被它全部排除在外。你取道于人，而不是跟着别人的脚步走。一切曾经生活过的人都是它的被遗忘的代理者。害怕和希望同样都在它的影响之下。即使在希望中也有不尽如人意之处，在幻想的时候，也没有什么东西可称之为感激，也没有什么充分的快乐。共性和永恒的因果关系被凌驾于激情之上的灵魂所看见，并发现了真理和正义的自我存在，因为知道事事顺心，所以就非常镇定。大自然的无限空间，大西洋、南太平洋——时光轮转，年复一年，世纪更迭——都没关系。我的所思所想曾是我每一种生活状态和处境的全部，现在依然没变，这就是所谓的生死的基础。

**Life only avails, not the having lived.** Power ceases in the instant of repose; it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state, in the shooting of the gulf, in the darting to an aim. This one fact the world hates, that the soul *becomes*; for that for ever degrades the past, turns all riches to poverty, all reputation to a shame, confounds the saint with the rogue, shoves Jesus and Judas equally aside. Why, then, do we prate of self-reliance? Inasmuch as the soul is present, there will be power not confident but agent. To talk of reliance is a poor external way of speaking. Speak rather of that which relies, because it works and is. Who has more obedience than I masters me, though he should not raise his finger. Round him I must revolve by the gravitation of spirits. We fancy it rhetoric, when we speak of eminent virtue. We do not yet see that virtue is Height, and that a man or a company of men, plastic and permeable to principles, by the law of nature must overpower and ride all cities, nations, kings, rich men, poets, who are not.

有用的只是生命，而不是逝去的岁月。一旦静止，力就不复存在；它存在于由旧到新的状态的过渡时刻，存在于对海湾的冲击之中，存在于向目标投掷之中。这是一个让世界讨厌的事实，却是灵魂形成的事实；因为它永远贬低过去，把富足转变成贫困，把名誉转化为耻辱，把圣人与无赖混为一谈，把耶稣和犹大一并推开。那为什么此时我们还要没完没了地谈论自立呢？因为有灵魂在，力量就在，它是原动力而不是自信力。谈论依赖只是一种拙劣而肤浅的话题。因为依赖在起作用并存在着，所以我们还是来说说有依赖作用的事吧。我主宰自己，有谁能比我更顺从自己呢？虽然这不费吹灰之力，我必须借用精神的引力围着他转。当我们谈到杰出的美德时，我们认为它言过其实。我们看不到美德就是“顶点”，也看不到一个人或一群人完全不适应接纳原则，就肯定会借助自然法则，征服和驾驭所有城市、国家、国王、富翁和诗人，因为这些全都不是顶点。

This is the ultimate fact which we so quickly reach on this, as on every topic, the resolution of all into the ever-blessed ONE. Self-existence is the attribute of the Supreme Cause, and it constitutes the measure of good by the degree in which it enters into all lower forms. All things real are so by so much virtue as they contain. Commerce, husbandry, hunting, whaling, war, eloquence, personal weight, are somewhat, and engage my respect as examples of its presence and impure action. I see the same law working in nature for conservation and growth. Power is in nature the essential measure of right. Nature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdoms which cannot help itself. The genesis and maturation of a planet, its poise and orbit, the bended tree recovering itself from the strong wind, the vital resources of every animal and vegetable, are demonstrations of the self-sufficing, and therefore self-relying soul.

如同在每一个论题上一样，在这个问题上，我们也迅速的在这一论题上获得一个根本性的事实：一切事物都归于万能的上帝。自立精神是造物主的属性。它不同程度的进入了所有较低级的生命形式，它按照这种程度制定了衡量善的标准。真实的万物所包含的优点决定了它们的真实程度。商务、农牧、狩猎、捕鲸、战争、雄辩、个人影响都是重要的东西，无论是代表存在的美行还是虚假的行为，都会赢得我的敬仰。我看到自然界中同一条法则在为保护与发展发挥作用。能力是自然界中衡量正义的基本标准。任何没有自立能力的东西是不被大自然允许滞留在她的各个领域的。一颗行星的产生和成熟，它的平衡和轨道，狂风过后弯下的树又直起身来，每一个动植物的生命力，诸如此类，都是自给自足的，因此也是自立的灵魂的表现。

Thus all concentrates: let us not rove; let us sit at home with the cause. Let us stun and astonish the intruding rabble of men and books and institutions, by a simple declaration of the divine fact. Bid the invaders take the shoes from off their feet, for God is here within. Let our simplicity judge them, and our docility to our own law demonstrate the poverty of nature and fortune beside our native riches.

这样，一切都在集中：让我们不必漂泊，让我们足不出户。让我们只是宣布一下这神圣的事实，叫那些乱哄哄的强行闯入的人、书和制度目瞪口呆吧。叫侵入者脱下脚上的鞋，因为上帝就在这里。以我们的单纯来对他们作出裁决，以对自我法则的顺从向他们展示大自然的贫穷和我们自己的财富以外的富足。

But now we are a mob. Man does not stand in awe of man, nor is his genius admonished to stay at home, to put itself in communication with the internal ocean, but it goes abroad to beg a cup of water of the urns of other men. We must go alone. I like the silent church before the service begins, better than any preaching. How far off, how cool, how chaste the persons look, begirt each one with a precinct or sanctuary! So let us always sit. Why should we assume the faults of our friend, or wife, or father, or child, because they sit around our hearth, or are said to have the same blood? All men have my blood, and I have all men's. Not for that will I adopt their petulance or folly, even to the extent of being ashamed of it. But your isolation must not be mechanical, but spiritual, that is, must be elevation. At times the whole world seems to be in conspiracy to importune you with emphatic trifles. Friend, client, child, sickness, fear, want, charity, all knock at once at thy closet door, and say, — 'Come out unto us.' But keep thy state; come not into their confusion. The power men possess to annoy me, I give them by a weak curiosity. No man can come near me but through my act. "What we love that we have, but by desire we bereave ourselves of the love."

然而现在我们是凡人。人对他人毫无敬畏之心，他的天才得不到规劝留在家里，好让自己与内心的海洋交流，而是走到户外从别人的缸里乞讨一杯水。我们必须独自往来。我喜欢礼拜仪式开始前沉默的教堂，那胜过任何形式的布道。那些人看起来那么遥远，那么冷漠、那么贞洁，让自己置身于自己的礼拜座位中或圣所中。所以，让我们永远坐着。为什么我们应该装出我们的朋友、妻子、父亲或者孩子的那副糊涂样，就因为我和他们围坐在炉边，有着据说和我们一样的血统吗？所有人与我血统相同，我与所有人血统相同。我并不会因为就要继承他们的暴躁或愚蠢，我甚至不会为此感到羞耻。然而你的孤立不是物质上的，而应该是精神上的，换句话说，就是一定要崇高。有时候，全世界好像都在阴谋把琐事夸大其词的来纠缠你。朋友、客人、孩子、疾病、恐惧、匮乏、施舍，聚集到一起来敲你的私人房间的门，说道：“出来，跟我们在一起。”然而，保持你原来的状态；千万别出来卷进他们的纠纷。人们是很有打扰我的本事的，我只能是淡然处之。除了经过我的允许，否则谁也不能接近我。“爱我所爱，有时候欲望过多反会使我们失去这种爱。”

If we cannot at once rise to the sanctities of obedience and faith, let us at least resist our temptations; let us enter into the state of war, and wake Thor and Woden, courage and constancy, in our Saxon breasts. This is to be done in our smooth times by speaking the truth. Check this lying hospitality and lying affection. Live no longer to the expectation of these deceived and deceiving people with whom we converse. Say to them, O father, O mother, O wife, O brother, O friend, I have lived with you after appearances hitherto. Henceforward I am the truth's. Be it known unto you that henceforward I obey no law less than the eternal law. I will have no covenants but proximities. To nourish my parents, to support my family I shall endeavour, to be the chaste husband of one wife, — but these relations I must fill after a new and unprecedented way. I appeal from your customs that I must be myself. I cannot break myself any longer for you, or you. If you can love me for what I am, we shall be the happier. If you cannot, I will still seek to deserve that you should. I will not hide my tastes or aversions. I will so trust that what is deep is holy, that I will do strongly before the sun and moon whatever inly rejoices me, and the heart appoints. If you are noble, I will love you; I will not hurt you and myself by hypocritical attentions if you are not. If you are true, but not in the same truth with me, cleave to your companions; I will seek my own. I do this not selfishly, but humbly and truly. It is alike your interest, and mine, and all men's, however long we have dwelt in lies, to live in truth. Does this sound harsh to-day? You will soon love what is dictated by your nature as well as mine, and, if we follow the truth, it will bring us out safe at last. — But so you may give these friends pain. Yes, but I cannot sell my liberty and my power, to save their sensibility. Besides, all persons have their moments of reason, when they look out into the region of absolute truth; then will they justify me, and do the same thing.

倘若我们不能一步到位，拥有服从与信任的神圣情感，至少也应该抵制诱惑；让我们进入战争状态；唤醒雷神和战神，以撒克逊人的胸怀做到勇敢和坚定。这一点在和平年代敢于讲真话就能做到。制止这种虚情假意吧。别再让那些和我们交谈的受骗的和骗人的人心存幻想。对他们说，父亲啊，母亲啊，妻子啊，兄弟啊，朋友啊，一直到现在，我一直在表面上跟你们生活在一起。从今往后，我要做真诚的人。现在让你们知道，从现在起，我绝不服从低于永恒法则的任何法则。我不要盟约，只要亲近。我将尽全力赡养父母、抚育孩子，做妻子的忠诚的丈夫——但是供养这些亲属，我必须用一种前所未有的新方法。不服从于习俗，而是做真正的自我。我再也不能为了你毁了自己或者你。如果你爱我是看中我的本质，那么我们会更加幸福。如果你做不到，我也能明白你们自有道理。我并不愿意掩饰自己的好恶。我愿意真心希望：只要是深沉的东西，就是神圣的东西；我愿意真心希望：在日月面前，只要是让我发自内心的高兴的事，心灵委派的事，我都会义无反顾的去做。如果你高尚，我会爱你；如果你并非如此，我也不想假装殷勤去伤害彼此。如果你诚实，却不同于我的诚实，那么就去忠实于跟你志同道合的人；我也愿意寻找我的同道中人。我这样做并不是出于自私的心理，而是出于谦恭和真诚。无论我们在谎言中生活了多久，在真诚中生活同样符合你的、我的、所有人的利益。难道这些道理在今天听起来非常刺耳？你很快就会爱上你我的天性所设立的一切，而且如果我们追随真理，最终它会为我们指点迷津——然而，如此做法你可能会给这些朋友造成痛苦。的确如此，但我不会为了顾全他们的感情而出卖自己的自由和力量。况且，倘若将自己的眼光投向绝对真理的领域，人人都会有自己的理性时刻，那个时候，他们会证明我的正确并做和我一样的事。

The populace think that your rejection of popular standards is a rejection of all standard, and mere antinomianism; and the bold sensualist will use the name of philosophy to gild his crimes. But the law of consciousness abides. There are two confessionals, in one or the other of which we must be shriven. You may fulfil your round of duties by clearing yourself in the *direct*, or in the *reflex* way. Consider whether you have satisfied your relations to father, mother, cousin, neighbour, town, cat, and dog; whether any of these can upbraid you. But I may also neglect this reflex standard, and absolve me to myself. I have my own stern claims and perfect circle. It denies the name of duty to many offices that are called duties. But if I can discharge its debts, it enables me to dispense with the popular code. If any one imagines that this law is lax, let him keep its commandment one day.

普通大众觉得，你摒弃了通行的标准就是抵触所有的标准，是纯粹的反律法主义：胆大包天的好色之徒会借哲学的名义为他们的罪恶镀金。但是，意识的法则常在。有两种忏悔，我们想要赎罪的话就必须做到其中之一。你可以采取直接方式，也可以采取反省的方式来澄清自己，从而完成你一系列的职责。考虑一下你是否满足了你和父亲、母亲、表兄弟、邻居、城镇、猫狗之类的关系；他们当中的每一个是否能够责备你。但是我也可以无视这种反省的标准来自我赦免。我有自己特有的严苛要求和完善的轮回方式。意识法则否认所谓的职责，我若能为它开罪，它便能帮我抛弃世俗的法规。要是有人认为这个法则太宽容的话，那就让他花一天的时间去遵守它的戒律好了。

And truly it demands something godlike in him who has cast off the common motives of humanity, and has ventured to trust himself for a taskmaster. High be his heart, faithful his will, clear his sight, that he may in good earnest be doctrine, society, law, to himself, that a simple purpose may be to him as strong as iron necessity is to others!

丢掉人的普通动机，敢于相信自己会做一名领头人，是需要非同寻常的勇气的。他要心地高尚，意念忠诚，目光犀利，这样，他才会堂堂正正的自立学说，自立社会，自立法律。这样，他的一个简单的目的才可以像别人的铁定的需要那样坚强。

If any man consider the present aspects of what is called by distinction *society*, he will see the need of these ethics. The sinew and heart of man seem to be drawn out, and we are become timorous, desponding whimperers. We are afraid of truth, afraid of fortune, afraid of death, and afraid of each other. Our age yields no great and perfect persons. We want men and women who shall renovate life and our social state, but we see that most natures are insolvent, cannot satisfy their own wants, have an ambition out of all proportion to their practical force, and do lean and beg day and night continually. Our housekeeping is mendicant, our arts, our occupations, our marriages, our religion, we have not chosen, but society has chosen for us. We are parlour soldiers. We shun the rugged battle of fate, where strength is born.

人们明确的把某种东西称为社会，如果有人把它的各方面都考虑一下的话，他就会看到这些道德准则的必要性。人的肌肉和心脏似乎被抽出去了，于是我们就变的胆小如鼠、颓废消极、哭哭啼啼。我们害怕真理，害怕命运，害怕死亡，甚至害怕他人。我们的时代不能产生完美的伟人。我们需要这样的男女，他们能革新生活、革新我们的社会状况，可是我们发现大多数都是些破产的人，他们连自己都不能养活，空有豪情壮志，却无能为力，只好日夜委屈自己去乞讨。我们持家就等于乞讨，我们的艺术、职业、婚姻、宗教，都不是我们的选择，而是社会替我们选择的。我们是纸上谈兵的士兵，躲避着命运的恶战，而事实上战斗才是力量的源泉。

**If our young men miscarry in their first enterprises, they lose all heart.** Men say he is *ruined if the young merchant fails*. If the finest genius studies at one of our colleges, and is not installed in an office within one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of Boston or New York, it seems to his friends and to himself that he is right in being disheartened, and in complaining the rest of his life. A sturdy lad from New Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the professions, who *teams it*, *farms it*, *peddles*, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls. He walks abreast with his days, and feels no shame in not 'studying a profession,' for he does not postpone his life, but lives already. He has not one chance, but a hundred chances. Let a Stoic open the resources of man, and tell men they are not leaning willows, but can and must detach themselves; that with the exercise of self-trust, new powers shall appear; that a man is the word made flesh, born to shed healing to the nations, that he should be ashamed of our compassion, and that the moment he acts from himself, tossing the laws, the books, idolatries, and customs out of the window, we pity him no more, but thank and revere him, — and that teacher shall restore the life of man to splendor, and make his name dear to all history.

如果在他们的第一个事业中受挫，年轻人就会彻底的丧失信心。如果年轻商人失败了，人们就会说他破产了。如果一所大学里的优秀高材生，毕业一年之后还没有在波士顿或者纽约的市区或郊区工作，他和他的朋友似乎都认为他应该灰心丧气，抱怨终生。从新罕布什尔或佛蒙特来的一个健壮小伙儿一一尝试了所有职业，他赶过车，种过地，当过走街串巷的小贩，办过学校，当过牧师，编过报纸，进过议会，买过一块六英尺见方的地皮，诸如此类，不胜枚举，多年以来永远像猫一样从没摔过跤，他自身的价值抵得上城市里的一百个庸人。他与时俱进，并不会因为没有“术业有专攻”而感觉低人一等，因为他并没有虚度此生。他并非只有一个机会，而是有上百个机会。让一个斯多葛主义者放开人的聪明才智，告诉人们：他们没有背靠柳树，不仅有能力，而且必须超凡脱俗。新的力量一定会随着自信的实施而出现。一个人就是诺言构成的肉体，生下来就是为了医治这个民族，他应该以我们的怜悯之心为耻，一旦他自主行事，把法律、书本、偶像和习俗统统扔到窗外，我们就不再怜悯他，而是要感激和尊敬他——而且那位导师一定会重现人生的光彩，让人名留史册。

It is easy to see that a greater self-reliance must work a revolution in all the offices and relations of men; in their religion; education; and in their pursuits; their modes of living; their association; in their property; in their speculative views.

要使一种更伟大的自立精神在人们的一切职责和关系中掀起一场革命并不难。在他们的教育中、事业中、生活方式中、社会交往中、财产中以及理论观点中。

**1. In what prayers do men allow themselves!** That which they call a holy office is not so much as brave and manly. Prayer looks abroad and asks for some foreign addition to come through some foreign virtue, and loses itself in endless mazes of natural and supernatural, and mediatorial and miraculous. It is prayer that craves a particular commodity, — any thing less than all good, — is vicious. Prayer is the contemplation of the facts of life from the highest point of view. It is the soliloquy of a beholding and jubilant soul. It is the spirit of God pronouncing his works good. But prayer as a means to effect a private end is meanness and theft. It supposes dualism and not unity in nature and consciousness. As soon as the man is at one with God, he will not beg. He will then see prayer in all action. The prayer of the farmer kneeling in his field to weed it, the prayer of the rower kneeling with the stroke of his oar, are true prayers heard throughout nature, though for cheap ends. Caratach, in Fletcher's Bonduca, when admonished to inquire the mind of the god Audate, replies, —

> "His hidden meaning lies in our endeavours;
> Our valors are our best gods."

首先，人们再做怎样的祈祷啊！他们所谓的神职缺乏勇敢和果断。祈祷的眼睛向外看，要求某种外来的美德寻求某种外物的补充，结果让自己在自然的和超自然的、协调的和奇迹般的无穷无尽的迷宫中迷失了。恳求某种商品——一种绝非完美的东西——是邪恶之举。祈祷是从最高的观点出发对生活事实进行沉思。它是一个观察着的欢喜的灵魂的自言自语。是上帝宣布自己功德时的精神实质。然而，把祈祷当作一种达到一己私欲的手段，就等于是卑鄙和偷窃了。它表示天性和意识之间存在着两重性和不统一。只有人和上帝合而为一时，他才不会有所乞求。那时，他会从一切行动中看到祈祷的存在。农民在自己的地里跪着祈祷除去杂草，船夫在一边划桨一边跪在船上祈祷，尽管目的都不怎么高贵，但这些都是回荡在自然界中真正的祈祷。弗莱彻的《邦杜卡》一剧中的卡拉塔奇，在人们劝他探究一下奥达特神的心意时，他回答说：

> 他的言外之意隐藏在我们的努力中；
>
> 我们的英勇就是我们的真神。

Another sort of false prayers are our regrets. Discontent is the want of self-reliance: it is infirmity of will. Regret calamities, if you can thereby help the sufferer; if not, attend your own work, and already the evil begins to be repaired. Our sympathy is just as base. We come to them who weep foolishly, and sit down and cry for company, instead of imparting to them truth and health in rough electric shocks, putting them once more in communication with their own reason. The secret of fortune is joy in our hands. Welcome evermore to gods and men is the self-helping man. For him all doors are flung wide: him all tongues greet, all honors crown, all eyes follow with desire. Our love goes out to him and embraces him, because he did not need it. We solicitously and apologetically caress and celebrate him, because he held on his way and scorned our disapprobation. The gods love him because men hated him. "To the persevering mortal," said Zoroaster, "the blessed Immortals are swift."

另一种虚假的祈祷就是我们的悔恨。不满就等于缺乏自立：也就是意志薄弱。如果悔恨灾难就能帮助受灾者的话，那就去悔恨吧；如果收效甚微，还是专心干你自己的事吧，这样，就已经开始补救灾害了。怜悯一样是低级行为。我们去看望他们，他们就连哭带嚎的，我们只好坐下来陪他们一起哀嚎，而不是向他们传授真理从而使之获得心灵的康复，或是给他们强烈的震撼，使他们重新与自己的理智交流。我们手上的快乐就是我们的幸运秘诀。自立的人永远受到神和人的青睐。所有的大门都为他敞开；无数的言语向他致敬，所有的荣誉汇集他一身，所有的目光都热切的注视着他。我们的爱出去找他，拥抱他，因为他并不曾需要。我们热心的、满怀歉意的抚爱他，赞美他，因为他从来只按自己的意思行事，从来都无视别人的非难。因为众人恨他所以诸神爱他。“在不屈不挠的凡人眼中，享受庇佑的神不过转瞬即逝。”索罗亚斯德说。

As men's prayers are a disease of the will, so are their creeds a disease of the intellect. They say with those foolish Israelites, 'Let not God speak to us, lest we die. Speak thou, speak any man with us, and we will obey.' Everywhere I am hindered of meeting God in my brother, because he has shut his own temple doors, and recites fables merely of his brother's, or his brother's brother's God. Every new mind is a new classification. If it prove a mind of uncommon activity and power, a Locke, a Lavoisier, a Hutton, a Bentham, a Fourier, it imposes its classification on other men, and lo! a new system. In proportion to the depth of the thought, and so to the number of the objects it touches and brings within reach of the pupil, is his complacency. But chiefly is this apparent in creeds and churches, which are also classifications of some powerful mind acting on the elemental thought of duty, and man's relation to the Highest. Such is Calvinism, Quakerism, Swedenborgism. The pupil takes the same delight in subordinating every thing to the new terminology, as a girl who has just learned botany in seeing a new earth and new seasons thereby. It will happen for a time, that the pupil will find his intellectual power has grown by the study of his master's mind. But in all unbalanced minds, the classification is idolized, passes for the end, and not for a speedily exhaustible means, so that the walls of the system blend to their eye in the remote horizon with the walls of the universe; the luminaries of heaven seem to them hung on the arch their master built. They cannot imagine how you aliens have any right to see, — how you can see; 'It must be somehow that you stole the light from us.' They do not yet perceive, that light, unsystematic, indomitable, will break into any cabin, even into theirs. Let them chirp awhile and call it their own. If they are honest and do well, presently their neat new pinfold will be too strait and low, will crack, will lean, will rot and vanish, and the immortal light, all young and joyful, million-orbed, million-colored, will beam over the universe as on the first morning.

人们的祈祷是意志上的一种疾病，同理，他们的信条是智能上的一种疾病。他们对那些痴心的上帝选民说：“假如上帝不和我们说话，恐怕我们会死的。你说吧，随便哪个人跟我们说，我们都言听计从。”无论走到哪里，我们都无法与我兄弟心中的上帝会面，因为他已经关上了他的圣殿的大门，仅仅在重复他兄弟的上帝，或者他兄弟的兄弟的上帝的寓言。每一个新的心灵就是一个新的类别。如果是一个异常活跃、能力超群的头脑，比如洛克、拉瓦锡、赫盾、边沁、傅立叶的头脑，那它就把自己的分类强加到别人身上了，看！一个崭新的系统。他的骄傲自满与其思想深度，及其触及并带给学生的事物之数量都恰到好处。但是，这一点尤其明显的表现在教义和教会中，因为教义和教会也是某个睿智的头脑依照基本的职责思想，依照人与上帝的关系建立的类别。加尔文派，贵格派，斯维登堡派莫不如此。学生喜欢以新术语为中心来讨论一切，好比一个新学了生物学的女生喜欢从中看到新土壤和新季节一样。一段时间之后，他会发现他的智力通过他对他的老师的研究而增长了。可是在所有紊乱的心灵里，这种类别被偶像化了，它不被看作一种可以很快用尽的手段，而只被看作目的。因此，在他们看来，在遥远的地平线上，系统已经与宇宙融为一体了；天空中的日月星辰看起来就挂在他们老师构建的苍穹中。他们无法想象你们这些异类怎么有权看到——你们怎能看见；“必然是你们用某种手段从我们这里盗取了光明。”由于不成系统，那种光顽强不屈，会射进任何陋室破屋，甚至他们的也不例外；他们还是看不出来。让他们七嘴八舌的去争论一会吧，然后就将其据为己有。如果他们诚实、举止得体，那么他们整洁、崭新的棚屋立刻就会显得太狭窄，太低矮，立刻就会破裂、倾斜、腐坏甚至消失，而那不朽的光散发着青春的快乐气息，光芒万丈，五彩缤纷，将会照彻宇宙，就像创世之初的第一个清晨所作的那样。

**2. It is for want of self-culture that the superstition of Travelling, whose idols are Italy, England, Egypt, retains its fascination for all educated Americans.** They who made England, Italy, or Greece venerable in the imagination did so by sticking fast where they were, like an axis of the earth. In manly hours, we feel that duty is our place. The soul is no traveller; the wise man stays at home, and when his necessities, his duties, on any occasion call him from his house, or into foreign lands, he is at home still, and shall make men sensible by the expression of his countenance, that he goes the missionary of wisdom and virtue, and visits cities and men like a sovereign, and not like an interloper or a valet. 

其次，人们因为缺乏自我修养而迷信旅游，并崇拜意大利、英国、埃及的文化。所有受过教育的美国人至今对旅游痴心不改。而那些使英国、意大利或者希腊在人的想象中受人敬仰的人们却如同一根地轴一样，固守着自己的位置，吸引更多的来者。在做决定的时候，我们觉得职责就在我们的岗位上。灵魂肯定不是一个游客；智者固守家园，如果出于需要，出于职责，叫他离家出走或者客走异乡，他也依然滞留家中，而且还用他的面部表情让人们产生这样的想法，他是在传播智慧和美德，，就像国王一样的访走访城市，拜会他人，而不是像一个商人或仆人。

I have no churlish objection to the circumnavigation of the globe, for the purposes of art, of study, and benevolence, so that the man is first domesticated, or does not go abroad with the hope of finding somewhat greater than he knows. He who travels to be amused, or to get somewhat which he does not carry, travels away from himself, and grows old even in youth among old things. In Thebes, in Palmyra, his will and mind have become old and dilapidated as they. He carries ruins to ruins.

只要人首先喜欢家居，不指望为了获得比他现有的知识更高超的知识而出国，我就不会武断的反对那些为了艺术、研究和慈善目的的环球旅行。为了享乐和猎奇而旅游是脱离自我的旅游，置身于古旧事物之中，即使正值年少，也会变老。在底比斯、帕米尔拉，他的意志已经变成那些城市那样，古老而坍塌。他把废墟带进了废墟。

Travelling is a fool's paradise. Our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places. At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can be intoxicated with beauty, and lose my sadness. I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I fled from. The Vatican, and the palaces I seek. But I am not intoxicated though I affect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions. My giant goes with me wherever I go.

旅游是傻子的天堂。最初，我们的旅程是我们发现了那些地方的冷漠。我在家里梦想着：在那不勒斯，在罗马，我可以陶醉在美中，丢掉悲伤。我收拾好行李，和朋友拥抱之后，登船出海，最后自那不勒斯醒来，身边严峻的事实让人无奈，伤心自己依然如故，只有逃离这一切。我寻找梵蒂冈和那些圣殿。在景色和联想中我假意沉醉，实际上却并未沉醉。我的巨人会陪伴我走到任何地方。

**3. But the rage of travelling is a symptom of a deeper unsoundness affecting the whole intellectual action.** The intellect is vagabond, and our system of education fosters restlessness. Our minds travel when our bodies are forced to stay at home. We imitate; and what is imitation but the travelling of the mind? Our houses are built with foreign taste; Shelves are garnished with foreign ornaments; but our opinions, our tastes, our faculties, lean, and follow the Past and the Distant. The soul created the arts wherever they have flourished. It was in his own mind that the artist sought his model. It was an application of his own thought to the thing to be done and the conditions to be observed. And why need we copy the Doric or the Gothic model? Beauty, convenience, grandeur of thought, and quaint expression are as near to us as to any, and if the American artist will study with hope and love the precise thing to be done by him, considering the climate, the soil, the length of the day, the wants of the people, the habit and form of the government, he will create a house in which all these will find themselves fitted, and taste and sentiment will be satisfied also.

再次，可是旅游的狂热是影响整个智力行为的一种深刻而不健全的征兆。智力是居无定所的，我们的教育制度只会滋生浮躁。尽管我们的身体被迫困在家里，但我们的心灵还在四处游荡。除了心灵的四处游荡，我们的模仿还会是什么呢？我们按外国情调建筑房屋；用外国装饰品装饰橱柜；我们的见解、爱好、才能都十分贫乏，还在追随着“过去”和“远方”。灵魂创造艺术的地方正是艺术已经繁荣的地方。艺术家正是在他的心灵里寻找他的模型。那只不过是他在要做的事情上和要观察的环境上运用了自己的思想。为什么我们要照搬陶立克式或哥特式的原型呢？美好、方便、宏大的思想，及其优雅的表现，离我们和别人都是一样近，如果美国艺术家对他们要做的事能满怀希望和爱心的去研究，考虑过气候、土壤、昼长、人民需求、政府习性和形式之后，他就会创造一座适合所有人居住的房子，而且还可以满足情趣。

Insist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift you can present every moment with the cumulative force of a whole life's cultivation; but of the adopted talent of another, you have only an extemporaneous, half possession. That which each can do best, none but his Maker can teach him. No man yet knows what it is, nor can, till that person has exhibited it. Where is the master who could have taught Shakspeare? Where is the master who could have instructed Franklin, or Washington, or Bacon, or Newton? Every great man is a unique. The Scipionism of Scipio is precisely that part he could not borrow. Shakspeare will never be made by the study of Shakspeare. Do that which is assigned you, and you cannot hope too much or dare too much. There is at this moment for you an utterance brave and grand as that of the colossal chisel of Phidias, or trowel of the Egyptians, or the pen of Moses, or Dante, but different from all these. Not possibly will the soul all rich, all eloquent, with thousand-cloven tongue, deign to repeat itself; but if you can hear what these patriarchs say, surely you can reply to them in the same pitch of voice; for the ear and the tongue are two organs of one nature. Abide in the simple and noble regions of thy life, obey thy heart, and thou shalt reproduce the Foreworld again.

坚持自我；绝不模仿。你随时可以用你终生修养的积蓄力量表现出你自己的天赋；可是，你若沿袭别人的才华，你就只能临时地、部分地占有它。每个人的长处，除了他的造物主没人能教给他。除非他展示自己的长处，否则没人知道那是什么。哪有教莎士比亚的老师？哪有能指导富兰克林、华盛顿、培根和牛顿的导师？每一个伟大的人物都是独一无二的。西庇阿的西庇阿主义正是常人无法借取的。研究莎士比亚就永远不会成为莎士比亚。做好交待给你的事吧，不要奢望太高、鲁莽行事。这个时候，给你一种勇敢而崇高的表达方式，就像菲迪亚斯的巨大凿子，埃及人的巨型泥刀，摩西或但丁的大笔，但和这些又略有不同。尽管灵魂满腹经纶，雄辩无敌，也不可能自贬身份重复自己；不过，假如你听的见这些始祖说的话，你肯定也能用同样的声调去回答他们。因为耳朵和舌头虽然分属两种器官，但性质却是一致。安身于你生命的纯朴、高尚的领域，接受心灵的指挥，你一定会再现“前世”。

**4. As our Religion, our Education, our Art look abroad, so does our spirit of society.** All men plume themselves on the improvement of society, and no man improves.

最后，如果我们的宗教、教育、艺术的眼睛都放眼国外，社会风气也会如此。所有人都以社会改良为荣耀，却没有一个人有所改进。

Society never advances. It recedes as fast on one side as it gains on the other and undergoes continual changes; it is barbarous, civilized, christianized, rich and it is scientific; but this change is not amelioration. For every thing that is given, something is taken. Society acquires new arts, and loses old instincts. What a contrast between the well-clad, reading, writing, thinking American, with a watch, a pencil, and a bill of exchange in his pocket, and the naked New Zealander, whose property is a club, a spear, a mat, and an undivided twentieth of a shed to sleep under! But compare the health of the two men, and you shall see that the white man has lost his aboriginal strength. If the traveller tell us truly, strike the savage with a broad axe, and in a day or two the flesh shall unite and heal as if you struck the blow into soft pitch, and the same blow shall send the white to his grave.

社会从没有前进。其倒退和进步都是一样的迅速。他不断的经历改革；野蛮社会的，文明社会的，基督社会的，富裕社会的，科学社会的，都会有，然而这种改革却不是改进。因为有得必有失。社会在得到新技艺的同时失去了原有的本能。穿着讲究，会读书、写字、思索的美国人跟赤身裸体的新西兰人的对比多么鲜明，前者有怀表、铅笔和汇票在口袋里，后者的财产仅限于一根木棍、一支长矛、一张草席，以及一间很多人共睡的木屋。可是，对比两者的健康状况你就会发现，白人原有的体力早己丧失了。假如旅行家所讲的是真的话，那么，试试用大斧子砍那个野人，一两天后，肉就会愈合，仿佛你先前砍进去的是柔软的树脂似的。可是，白人被那样砍就会没命。

The civilized man has built a coach, but has lost the use of his feet. He is supported on crutches, but lacks so much support of muscle. He has a fine Geneva watch, but he fails of the skill to tell the hour by the sun. A Greenwich nautical almanac he has, and so being sure of the information when he wants it, the man in the street does not know a star in the sky. The solstice he does not observe; the equinox he knows as little; and the whole bright calendar of the year is without a dial in his mind. His note-books impair his memory; his libraries overload his wit; the insurance-office increases the number of accidents; and it may be a question whether machinery does not encumber; whether we have not lost by refinement some energy, by a Christianity entrenched in establishments and forms, some vigor of wild virtue. For every Stoic was a Stoic; but in Christendom where is the Christian?

造出马车的文明人却失去利用双脚的能力。他的身体用拐杖来支撑却失去了肌肉的支持。他拥有了高级的日内瓦表却失去了靠太阳判断时间的能力。他有一份格林威治天文年鉴，只要需要就必定会得到资料，可是大街上的普通人却不认识天上的星星。他不懂得观察夏至日和冬至日，也不懂得观察春分日和秋分日；整个年历清清楚楚，而他的脑子里却没有标记。笔记本损坏了他的记忆；图书馆让他的智力不堪重负；保险公司让事故频发。机器有害没害，我们有没有因为讲究文雅而失去活力，有没有因为陷于教条和形式中而失去某种粗犷的气质，这些都是问题。因为每个斯多葛都是斯多葛；但是，在基督教世界，哪儿有基督徒？

There is no more deviation in the moral standard than in the standard of height or bulk. No greater men are now than ever were. A singular equality may be observed between the great men of the first and of the last ages; nor can all the science, art, religion, and philosophy of the nineteenth century avail to educate greater men than Plutarch's heroes, three or four and twenty centuries ago. Not in time is the race progressive. Phocion, Socrates, Anaxagoras, Diogenes, are great men, but they leave no class. He who is really of their class will not be called by their name, but will be his own man, and, in his turn, the founder of a sect. The arts and inventions of each period are only its costume, and do not invigorate men. The harm of the improved machinery may compensate its good. Hudson and Behring accomplished so much in their fishing-boats, as to astonish Parry and Franklin, whose equipment exhausted the resources of science and art. Galileo, with an opera-glass, discovered a more splendid series of celestial phenomena than any one since. Columbus found the New World in an undecked boat. It is curious to see the periodical disuse and perishing of means and machinery, which were introduced with loud laudation a few years or centuries before. The great genius returns to essential man. We reckoned the improvements of the art of war among the triumphs of science, and yet Napoleon conquered Europe by the bivouac, which consisted of falling back on naked valor, and disencumbering it of all aids. The Emperor held it impossible to make a perfect army, says Las Casas, "without abolishing our arms, magazines, commissaries, and carriages, until, in imitation of the Roman custom, the soldier should receive his supply of corn, grind it in his hand-mill, and bake his bread himself."

道德标准上的偏差并不比高度或者体积上的偏差大。现在的人也不比以前的人伟大，我们可以看到，古代的伟人和现在的伟人没有什么高低之分。在十九世纪各种文化，包括科学、艺术、宗教和哲学一起发挥作用的条件下所培养出的人物们，并不显得比普鲁塔克笔下两千三四百年前的英雄们更伟大一些，人类的进步并不是和时间的推移成正比的，一些伟大的人物譬如福四翁、苏格拉底、阿那克萨戈拉、第欧根尼，他们并没有留下类别。如果有谁能达到他们的类别，也不会把自己归于该类别之下，而是会独树一帜，成为开山立派的宗师。任何一个时期的技艺和发明仅仅是那个时期的装束，也没有振奋人心。改良过的机器的害处抵消了它所带来的好处，哈德逊和白令的那么多的伟大业绩都是乘着渔船完成的，这让装备已经集科技之大成的巴利和富兰克林也惊叹不已。仅仅用了一个看戏用的小型望远镜，伽利略就发现了一系列史无前例、辉煌无比的天文现象。哥伦布发现新大陆的时候乘坐的是一只无甲板的小船。每隔一段时期，就有一批原来的工具和机器被淘汰，这种现象可能让人觉得有点迷惑不解，因为这些东西在刚开始被人采用时曾引起过很大的轰动。伟大的天才其实也是普通人。我们把战争艺术的改进归功于科学的功绩，然而，整个欧洲确实被拿破仑用露营征服的，在这个过程中，有赤手空拳与敌搏斗的英勇，也有置之死地而后生的信念。拿破仑认为，一支完善的部队是不存在的，是不可能建立的。拉斯·卡斯说：“并没有消灭我们的武器、弹药、粮食和车辆。然而到了后来，士兵效仿罗马人的做法，竟然自己解决粮食供应，用手磨磨面，自己来烤面包了。”

Society is a wave. The wave moves onward, but the water of which it is composed does not. The same particle does not rise from the valley to the ridge. Its unity is only phenomenal. The persons who make up a nation to-day, next year die, and their experience with them.

社会如同波浪，浪涛向前运动，海水却止步不前。同一个颗粒不会从低谷升到波峰，波浪的统一仅仅是表面现象而已。某些人今天创建了一个国家，第二年他死了，他们的经验也会随之消逝。

And so the reliance on Property, including the reliance on governments which protect it, is the want of self-reliance. Men have looked away from themselves and at things so long, that they have come to esteem the religious, learned, and civil institutions as guards of property, and they deprecate assaults on these, because they feel them to be assaults on property. They measure their esteem of each other by what each has, and not by what each is. But a cultivated man becomes ashamed of his property, out of new respect for his nature. Especially he hates what he has, if he see that it is accidental, — came to him by inheritance, or gift, or crime; then he feels that it is not having; it does not belong to him, has no root in him, and merely lies there, because no revolution or no robber takes it away. But that which a man is does always by necessity acquire, and what the man acquires is living property, which does not wait the beck of rulers, or mobs, or revolutions, or fire, or storm, or bankruptcies, but perpetually renews itself wherever the man breathes. "Thy lot or portion of life," said the Caliph Ali, "is seeking after thee; therefore be at rest from seeking after it." Our dependence on these foreign goods leads us to our slavish respect for numbers. The political parties meet in numerous conventions; the greater the concourse, and with each new uproar of announcement, The delegation from Essex! The Democrats from New Hampshire! The Whigs of Maine! the young patriot feels himself stronger than before by a new thousand of eyes and arms. In like manner the reformers summon conventions, and vote and resolve in multitude. Not so, O friends! will the God deign to enter and inhabit you, but by a method precisely the reverse. It is only as a man puts off all foreign support, and stands alone, that I see him to be strong and to prevail. He is weaker by every recruit to his banner. Is not a man better than a town? Ask nothing of men, and in the endless mutation, thou only firm column must presently appear the upholder of all that surrounds thee. He who knows that power is inborn, that he is weak because he has looked for good out of him and elsewhere, and so perceiving, throws himself unhesitatingly on his thought, instantly rights himself, stands in the erect position, commands his limbs, works miracles; just as a man who stands on his feet is stronger than a man who stands on his head.

因此，依赖财产，包括依赖保护财产的政府，这些表现都是缺乏自立。长期以来，人们只看物不看人，于是就把宗教、学术和政府的机构看作财产的卫士，如果攻击这些机构他们便会极力反对，因为他们觉得这是在攻击财产。他们衡量相互尊重的标准不是看一个人是什么，而是看一个人有什么。但是，一个有教养的人出于对自己天性的敬重会为自己的财产感到羞愧。他非常憎恨他所拥有的东西，假如它是意外的收获——通过继承和馈赠，或者是违法手段得来，于是他觉得那是不该拥有的，那不是他的东西，并没有根植于他身上，而只是放在那里，只是还没有被革命、强盗抢走而已。然而，人的生存取决于获取必要的东西，而活生生的财产就是人所获得的东西。它不听候统治者、暴民、革命、火灾、风暴或破产的差遣，而是跟着人自我更新，与他同呼吸，共命运。阿里哈里发说：“你的命运在追寻你，因而你就停止追寻吧。”我们对外来之物的过分依赖导致对数量的盲目推崇。政党们的会议越开越多，集会规模越来越大，每宣布一件事情就喧嚣一片。来自埃塞克斯的代表团！来自新罕布什尔的民主党人！来自缅因州的辉格党人！千万双眼睛在注视着，千万只臂膀在挥动着，此时此刻，爱国青年便感到比以往更加强大。改革家们也召集会议、投票选举、做大量的决定。不要再这样了，朋友们！想让上帝垂青进入你的心灵只有反其道而行之才行。人们只有放弃一切外援，独立自主我们才会看到他的强大和成功之处。他的麾下越是增加新兵，他就会变得越虚弱，难道一个人还不如一座城？不要去求别人什么，在无休止的变化中，你唯一的牢固支柱一定会立刻出现，支撑你周围的一切。如果有人知道力量是与生俱来的，知道自己软弱的原因是因为求助于外物的人，领悟到这一点，那谁都会毫不犹豫地依赖自己的思想，马上纠正自己，抬头挺胸，驾驭自己的躯体，去创造奇迹；就好像一个靠双脚站着的人比一个用头倒立的人更稳当一样。

So use all that is called Fortune. Most men gamble with her, and gain all, and lose all, as her wheel rolls. But do thou leave as unlawful these winnings, and deal with Cause and Effect, the chancellors of God. In the Will work and acquire, and thou hast chained the wheel of Chance, and shalt sit hereafter out of fear from her rotations. A political victory, a rise of rents, the recovery of your sick, or the return of your absent friend, or some other favorable event, raises your spirits, and you think good days are preparing for you. Do not believe it. Nothing can bring you peace but yourself. Nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of principles.

因此，充分去利用一切被称为“命运”的东西吧。大多数人都在跟命运赌博，要么大获全胜，要么满盘皆输，这都取决于她的轮子转向何方。但是，这些你赢得的东西，你必须要放下这些非法所得，再去跟“因果”这个上帝的司法官打交道吧。有“目的”地工作、获取吧，“机缘”的轮子已经被你拴住了，从此以后，不会为它的旋转而担心了。政治上的胜利，利益的增加，身体得以康复，久别的朋友得以重逢，或者其它的好事，都会让你的精神感到无比振奋，于是你就认为前面就是你的好日子了。不要相信。除了自己，没有什么可以带给你安宁。除了必胜的原则，什么也不能带给你安宁。
